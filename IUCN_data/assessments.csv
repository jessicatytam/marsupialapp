It occupies dense, mature woodlands containing Rock Sheoak (<em>Allocasuarina huegeliana</em>) and hollow-forming Wandoo (<em>Eucalyptus wandoo</em>). Females have up to 13 young in a litter, but only eight are raised (Bradley <em>et al.</em> 2008).","The historical decline of Red-tailed Phascogale was probably due to forest clearance and fragmentation, changed fire regimes (whereby frequent fire eliminated nest sites), and the presence of introduced predators. The species now occurs in a number of protected areas that are secure from habitat destruction and people in the region are very careful with fire, so there is no longer frequent burning. Populations and habitat are still fragmented.<br/><br/>The effects of cats and foxes on populations are not fully understood. There is no evidence that fox control has helped this largely arboreal species (A. Burbidge pers. comm.). The current range of the species, however, seems to be associated with the presence of <em>Gastrolobium</em> and <em>Oxylobium</em>, which produce monosodium fluoracetate ('1080' poison), which is lethal to foxes (Bradley <em>et al.</em> 2008).","Populations fluctuate with rainfall.

It nests within tree hollows during the day, and forages both on the ground and in trees mostly for invertebrates, but also some small vertebrates (Woinarski 2005). There is little information on the habitat requirements of this species. Most recent records are from tall open forest of <em>Eucalyptus miniata</em>-<em>E. tetrodonta</em> forests (Rhind <em>et al.</em> 2008).",Inappropriate fire regimes which alter the understorey to increase the presence of tall grasses (especially exotic grasses) and habitat degradation associated with pastoralism are the main threats to the species (Rhind <em>et al.</em> 2008). The clearance of vegetation is a threat in the western portion of the mainland range and on Melville Island where exotic tree plantations are detrimental and expanding (Firth <em>et al.</em> 2006; Rhind <em>et al.</em> 2008).

It does not appear to be consistently associated with any particular habitat type on the Tiwi Islands (Woinarski 2004). All known records of the species, however, have come from within 20 km of the coast (Woolley 2008), and the species does not occur within plantation forests (Firth <em>et al.</em> 2006). The habitat in the Kimberley was said to be heavily vegetated where backsoil country met sand plains, and the species was found among flood debris (Woinarski <em>et al.</em> 1996).

Nothing is known about the reproductive biology of this species except that a female collected from the Kimberley was carrying seven pouch young (Woolley 2008).","Because this species is rarely encountered, there is little certainty about the threats to it. Its rarity, however, is likely due to variety of threatening processes. Exotic predators (cats and possibly dogs), changes to the fire regime, and the destruction and degradation of habitat are all probable major threats (Woinarski 2004).

They occur in periglacial boulder fields (basalt, granite, granodiorites) overlain with mountain plum-pine <em>Podocarpus lawrenceii</em> heathland and adjacent alpine communities. The basalt boulderfields have the greatest population density. Mountain Pygmy Possums are nocturnal and terrestrial, but they are also adept climbers. It has a spring-summer diet composed predominantly of Bogong moths <em>Agrotis infusa</em> and other invertebrates with seeds and fruits important in late summer and autumn (Mansergh and Broome 1994). Females normally have one litter of 4 young following snowmelt in spring. All individuals accumulate subcutaneous fat during late summer and autumn and spend the winter in hibernation (about 7 months for adults and 5 months for juveniles; Geiser and Broome (1991)). Snow cover provides important insulation and protection to hibernating animals.","The extremely restricted habitat has been fragmented or destroyed by road construction, dam/aqueduct construction, and development of infrastructure for the downhill skiing industry. Approximately 50% of the habitat supporting the Mt. Bogong-Mt. Higginbotham population and 20% of the Kosciuszko habitat was burned in bushfires in January 2003, killing <em>Podocarpus</em> heathland aged from 50-400 years (L. Broome pers. comm.). The population at Mt. Buller suffers from fragmentation and subpopulations here and around ski resorts in the Kosciuszko area have declined severely since 2000 due to: habitat destruction, predation by feral cats, and possibly low snow cover. Predation by the introduced Red Fox is also a threat and the habitat is subject to weed invasion (e.g., willow <em>Salix</em> species). Bogong moths are migratory and have been found to carry arsenic from their breeding grounds in the Murray-Darling Basin to the mountains where it accumulates in food chains. Arsenic has been found in the scats of <em>B. parvus</em> and other small mammals, but the implications of this are as yet unknown (Green <em>et al.</em> 2001). <br/><br/>Marginalisation and loss of habitat and the severity of predation are predicted to increase with global warming. A recent trend of second litters following early snow melt has been observed at Mt. Buller (D. Heinze pers. comm.). Neither second litters nor their mothers are known to survive the winter because they are unable to accumulate the fat reserves necessary for successful hibernation through winter.","Common where they occur, but declining.

10331066,40540,Sarcophilus harrisii,Endangered,A2be+3e,2008,2008-06-30 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Listed as Endangered as standardized surveys indicate that the global Tasmanian Devil population has declined by more than 60% in the last 10 years (Hawkins <em>et al</em>. 2006, McCallum <em>et al</em>. 2007). Research indicates that an invariably fatal infectious cancer, Devil Facial Tumour Disease (DFTD), is responsible for the decline. DFTD currently occurs across the majority (estimated 60%) of the geographic range of the devil and continues to spread at variable rates (depending on location) in the range of 7-50 km/y (McCallum <em>et al</em>. 2007). Mark-recapture data from the most intensively studied population at Freycinet National Park estimated a decline in total population size of 30% in the first 3 years after disease arrival, with an annual decline in the adult (2+) population of 50% (Lachish <em>et al</em>. 2007). Both projections from these observed results and an epidemiological model predict local extinction at this site within 10 years of disease arrival (McCallum <em>et al</em>. 2007). At a second site, Mt William, where DFTD signs were first reported 10 years ago, mark-recapture methods estimate a decline of 90% over 10 years. There is no evidence either of a reduction in disease prevalence or of the rate of population decline as devil abundance reduces. On current information, we therefore project at least 90% population decline over the next 10 years across the 60% of the devil's distribution currently occupied by disease, with at least a 100 km extension of the disease distribution. Together, this would amount to a further decline (in excess of the 50% already observed) of at least 70% in the next 10 years, with widespread local extinctions. Whilst the cause of decline (DFTD) is understood, it has not ceased and its effects are not reversible with current knowledge.","Tasmanian Devils are found throughout Tasmania, in all native terrestrial habitats, as well as in forestry plantations and pasture, from sea level to all but the highest peaks of Tasmania (Jones and Rose 1996, Jones and Barmuta 2000). Densities are lowest in the buttongrass plains of the south-west and, prior to Devil Facial Tumour Disease (DFTD) emergence, highest in the dry and mixed sclerophyll forests and coastal heath of Tasmania's eastern half and north-west coast (Jones and Rose 1996). Open forests and woodlands are preferred, while tall or dense wet forests are avoided (Jones and Rose 1996; Jones and Barmuta 2000). The highest population densities are found in mixed patches of grazing land and forest or woodland. Relative trapping success and spool-and-line tracking indicate that Tasmanian Devils travel through lowlands, saddles and along creeks, avoiding steep slopes and rocky areas, and favouring predictably rich sources of food such as bush/pasture mosaics on farms, carcass and rubbish dumps, and roads (Jones and Barmuta 2000, Pukk 2005; N. Mooney and D. Pemberton pers. comm.).  Tasmanian Devils are able to reach very high densities, even in suboptimal habitat, if sufficient food and den sites are available. The 14 km² Badger Island at one time supported 120 Tasmanian Devils.<br/><br/>Seabird colonies, such as Short-tailed Shearwaters (or muttonbirds, <em>Puffinus tenuirostris</em>), are thought to have traditionally been a preferred habitat for Tasmanian Devils, providing an important food source. These are now much reduced along the east coast, but some sites remain along the west coast (D. Pemberton pers. comm.).<br/><br/>Dens are typically underground burrows (such as old wombat burrows), dense riparian vegetation, thick grass tussocks and caves. Adults are thought to remain faithful to their dens for life so den disturbance is destabilizing to populations (Owen and Pemberton 2005). In settled areas, dens are often under buildings which may be occupied by people.<br/><br/>Tasmanian Devils are the sole host to the only threatened invertebrate parasite, a tapeworm, <em>Dasyurotaenia robusta</em>, which is currently listed as Rare under the Tasmanian Threatened Species Protection Act 1995. <br/><br/><strong>Feeding</strong><br/>Tasmanian Devils are considered to be generalist predators and specialized scavengers; prey comprise primarily medium- to large-sized mammals, although they will eat large invertebrates such as bogong moths (<em>Agrotis infusa</em>) and the carcasses of any dead vertebrates, leading them to focus on areas where lambing, calving or wallaby shooting are in progress (Guiler 1970a, Jones and Barmuta 2000, Jones 2003, Owen and Pemberton 2005). Tasmanian Devils solitarily and actively hunt prey up to about 20 kg in size (including Bennett's Wallabies, <em>Macropus rufogriseus rufogriseus</em>, and Common Wombats, <em>Vombattus ursinus</em>) using a combination of ambush and short, moderate-speed pursuits (Jones 1998, 2003; Owen and Pemberton 2005).<br/><br/><strong>Movement patterns</strong><br/>Devils are usually nocturnal. There are no data to suggest seasonal changes in pattern of movement, apart from reduced activity of females with young in their dens (Pemberton 1990), although longer range movements (see below) are observed more frequently in winter. Tasmanian Devils occupy several different dens, changing dens every 1-3 days, and travelling a mean nightly distance of 8.6 km (Pemberton 1990). However, individuals have occasionally been observed to move up to 50 km in a single night (M. Jones pers. comm.). <br/><br/>Home ranges are found to overlap considerably. A typical home range across a two to four week period is estimated to be 13 km², ranging from 4-27 km² (Pemberton 1990). Different breeding females may be caught outside the same den site (Badger Island, N. Mooney unpubl.).<br/><br/><strong>Life-cycle</strong><br/>The Tasmanian Devil is promiscuous and breeds once a year during February to June (Hesterman <em>et al.</em> 2008; M. Jones pers. comm., Save the Tasmanian Devil Program unpubl.). In earlier studies the mating season was found to occur over a much shorter period, primarily during February-March (Guiler 1970b; D. Pemberton pers. comm.). <br/><br/>The majority of individuals mature at two years old; in DFTD-free areas, 5-10% of females typically mature at one year (Guiler 1970b; Hughes 1982; Pemberton 1990; Jones <em>et al</em>. in review; Hesterman <em>et al.</em>, in prep.). <br/><br/>Reproductive success is high in wild, non-diseased populations, with nearly all females of breeding age (2-4) bringing the full complement (n = 4) of pouched young through to weaning (Pemberton 1990; H. Hesterman unpubl.). Success to maturity of post-weaning individuals is unknown. <br/><br/>Tasmanian Devils are thought to breed and raise their young in traditional dens (Owen and Pemberton 2005), but new sites (e.g. under buildings) are also used. <br/><br/>Longevity in the wild is 5-6 years (Guiler 1978; Jones 2001; Jones <em>et al</em>. in press). The sum effect of mortality and emigration at Mount William (pre-disease) was estimated as 80% between the first and second year, followed by 20% in subsequent years (Pemberton 1990). <br/><br/>Increased contact between individuals in breeding season results in higher injury rates as a result of intra/inter-sexual aggression. DFTD is thought most likely to be most easily transmitted between Tasmanian Devils through biting (AUSVET 2005; Pearse and Swift 2006; Hamede 2007), therefore this is a time of higher potential for disease spread.","The major threat to this species at present is Devil Facial Tumour Disease (DFTD), compounded by roadkills, dog kills and persecution.<br/><br/><strong>Devil Facial Tumour Disease (DFTD)</strong><br/>Current evidence suggests that DFTD is an infectious, widespread disease (McCallum <em>et al.</em> 2007), so that any attempt to delineate boundaries between affected and unaffected locations is likely to be outdated swiftly. DFTD has been associated with local population declines of up to 89% since first reported (Hawkins <em>et al</em>. 2006, McCallum <em>et al</em>. 2007), indicated by long-term spotlighting data, widespread trapping and laboratory results. The declines, and the prevalence of the disease, have not eased off in any monitoring sites, and DFTD is present even in very low density areas. It is estimated that the adult population is approximately halving annually on the Freycinet peninsula (Lachish <em>et al</em>. 2007) with extinction predicted at this site 10-15 years after disease arrival (McCallum <em>et al</em>. 2007). Declines were most marked in areas where the disease had been reported earliest, in north-eastern and central eastern Tasmania.<br/><br/>Mean spotlighting sightings of Tasmanian Devils per 10 km route, obtained from across the core Tasmanian Devil range (eastern and north-western Tasmania), have declined by 53% since the first report of DFTD-like symptoms in 1996 (McCallum <em>et al</em>. 2007). The most immediately threatened location is thought to be the region where DFTD was reported prior to 2003: across 15,000 km² of eastern Tasmania. By 2005, the Devil Disease Project Team had confirmed DFTD in individuals found across 36,000 km² of eastern and central Tasmania (Hawkins <em>et al</em>. 2006). DFTD is now confirmed across more than 60% of the devil's overall distribution (C. Hawkins unpubl.), and there is evidence for continued geographical spread of the disease (Hawkins <em>et al</em>. 2006), so that Tasmanian Devils across between 51% and 100% of Tasmania may be, or have already been, subject to &gt;90% declines in a ten-year period. The currently affected region covers the majority of the formerly high-density eastern management unit, involving what was perhaps around 80% of the total population.<br/><br/>DTFD has resulted in the progressive loss of first the older adults from the population and then the younger adults (Lachish <em>et al</em>. 2007) so that populations are comprised of one and two year olds (Jones <em>et al</em>. in press, Lachish <em>et al</em>. submitted). As female devils usually breed for the first time at age two, they may not successfully raise a litter before they die of DFTD (Lachish <em>et al</em>. submitted). An increase in precocial breeding indicates some compensatory response, but as yet this appears to have been insufficient to counter mortality (Jones <em>et al</em>. in press, Lachish <em>et al</em>. submitted).<br/><br/>DFTD behaves like a frequency-dependent disease, probably because the majority of the injurious biting, which is the type of contact most likely to lead to disease transmission, occurs between adults during the mating season (Hamede <em>et al</em>. in press). Frequency-dependent diseases, which are typically sexually transmitted, can lead to extinction (McCallum and Jones 2006). Because transmission occurs between the sexes at mating irrespective of population density, these types of diseases lack a threshold density below which they become extinct.<br/><br/>Cannibalism is considered fairly common in Tasmanian Devils and renders the species particularly vulnerable to disease transmission (Pfennig <em>et al</em>. 1998; Jones <em>et al</em>. 2007). However, modes of transmission of DFTD are not as yet known.<br/><br/><strong>Road-kills</strong><br/>A recent three-year study of roadkill frequency on the main roads of Tasmania estimated 2,205 Tasmanian Devils are killed on roads annually (Hobday and Minstrell submitted). This suggests that 2-3.% of the total Tasmanian Devil population are killed on roads (based on an estimated population of 60,000–90,000 individuals at the time of the survey). The roaded parts of Tasmania closely match the core distribution area for Tasmanian Devils.<br/><br/>Roadkill was attributed as the cause of up to 50% and 20% of Tasmanian Devil death during a recording period of 17 months at Cradle Mountain and 12 months at Freycinet National Parks, respectively (Jones 2000; M. Jones pers. comm.). Local extinction and a similar rate of population decline at Cradle Mountain indicates that roadkill can cause local extinction, in which the road becomes a local sink (Jones 2000). Future impact is likely to remain at the same level.<br/><br/><strong>Dog kills</strong><br/>Reports of about 50 devils killed per year by poorly controlled dogs are served from about 20 dog owners. There is no obligation or incentive for such reports, and generally some hesitance even among those providing them, so the real figures are more likely of the order of several hundred devils killed by dogs each year.<br/><br/><strong>Foxes</strong><br/>There have been spasmodic, small-scale introductions of the Red Fox (<em>Vulpes vulpes</em>) into Tasmania since early European colonisation. Early incursions were sometimes efforts at acclimatisation and others for short-term hunting. More recently, there has been at least one accidental incursion (from a container ship in 1998) and credible reports of a concerted, malicious campaign of introduction. Hard evidence (confirmed scats, carcasses) of foxes has been found in the north-west and northern and southern midlands. Credible sighting reports have come from most of the eastern half of the State including the central highlands and the far north-west (Fox Free Tasmania 2006), mostly areas where Tasmanian Devil populations are suppressed by DFTD.<br/><br/>A commonly held view has been that the abundance of Tasmanian Devils has prevented fox establishment through interference competition, either aggressive exclusion or predation on denned juveniles (Jones <em>et al</em>. 2007). Red Foxes and Tasmanian Devils share preferences for den sites and habitat, and are of a similar size. Tasmanian Devils abundance is likely to slow, if not prevent, fox establishment. It is possible that foxes have been present in Tasmania for many decades at sub-detectable levels, and that a degree of ecological release has occurred due to DFTD, with foxes increasing to detectable numbers. The current impact of the Red Fox has been quantified (N. Mooney pers. comm.), and it is unlikely that fox numbers are currently at a level to impose a measurable impact.<br/><br/>A decline in Tasmanian Devils number may create a short to medium-term surplus of food, for example carrion; ideal for fox establishment. Fox establishment may cause both direct and indirect effects on Tasmanian Devils. Direct effects include (reciprocal) killing by then abundant foxes of then rare juvenile devils at dens while the female forages (Jones <em>et al</em>. 2007). Fox establishment may also cause ecosystem disruptions through changes in other species (Jones <em>et al</em>. 2007) - a feature of foxes on mainland Australia (e.g. Saunders <em>et al</em>. 1995) and something that might then also indirectly affect Tasmanian Devils. Tasmania has the potential to hold up to 250,000 foxes (based on modelling of habitat preferences and densities in south-east mainland Australian) which could replace most medium- to large-sized marsupial carnivores (N. Mooney unpubl.).<br/><br/><strong>Persecution</strong><br/>In the past, persecution of the Tasmanian Devil has been very high throughout settled parts of Tasmania, and is thought to have brought about very low numbers at times. Through the 1980s and 1990s, systematic poisoning in many sheep-growing areas (particularly fine-wool with its reliance on merinos) was widespread and probably killed in excess of 5000 devils per year (N. Mooney unpubl., from interviews with landowners). In the 1990s, control permits were occasionally issued to individuals who were able to argue that Tasmanian Devils were pests (e.g. killing valuable lambs).<br/><br/>Current persecution is much reduced, but can still be locally intense with in excess of 500 devils thought to be killed per year (N. Mooney pers. comm.). However, this is reducing since devil numbers have declined. While the small amount of current persecution is likely to persist it is unlikely to constitute a major threat unless the Tasmanian Devil population becomes extremely small and fragmented.<br/><br/><strong>Low genetic diversity</strong><br/>Jones <em>et al</em>. (2004) found the genetic diversity of Tasmanian Devils to be low relative to many Australian marsupials as well as placental carnivores. This was consistent with an island founder effect, but previous marked reductions in population size may also have played a role. Low genetic diversity can reduce population viability (Eldridge <em>et al</em>. 1999) and resistance to disease (Acevedo-Whitehouse <em>et al</em>. 2005).","In the early to mid-1990s, the total population estimate was 130,000–150,000 individuals (M. Jones pers. comm.; N. Mooney pers. comm.; DPIW unpubl.), based on extrapolations of population density estimates according to habitat. Systematic statewide spotlighting surveys have been carried out since 1985. Spotlighting sightings of Tasmanian Devils across the state have declined significantly since emergence of Devil Facial Tumour Disease (DFTD) in the mid-1990s: by 27% by early 2004, by 41% by early 2006, by 53% by early 2007 (Hawkins <em>et al.</em> 2006; McCallum <em>et al.</em> 2007), and by 64% by early 2008 (C. Hawkins <em>et al</em>. unpubl.). The decline was significantly sharper in regions where DFTD had been reported earliest, such that in north-east Tasmania, mean sightings have declined by 95% from 1992-1995 to 2005-2007, with no indication of recovery or plateau in decline. Comparison of mark-recapture results in the same area from the mid-1980s and 2007 supports this finding (McCallum <em>et al</em>. 2007). At the Freycinet peninsula, on the east coast of Tasmania, where the population has been monitored through trapping from 1999 to the present, the population has declined by at least 60% since the disease was first detected in 2001 and the adult population still appears to be halving annually (Lachish <em>et al</em>. 2007). Other indicators of devil abundance, such as roadkills, predation on stock, and carrion removal, also support this conclusion of a substantial decline.<br/><br/>If a 64% decline based on spotlighting surveys is applied to the population estimates from the mid-1990s, the 2007 population size would have been an estimated 25,000 mature individuals (50,000 individuals total). Another method generated an estimated total population size in 2004 of approximately 21,000 mature individuals (C. Hawkins, unpubl.). This estimate was derived from mark-recapture density estimates from ten sites (four disease-free sites, six diseased sites) in the highest density areas (north-east and south-east Tasmania) and from one disease free site outside the high density area. The population estimate at each trapping site incorporated 95% confidence intervals of +/-c. 25%. A standard buffer was placed around each trap site to calculate the area from which Tasmanian Devils are trapped during a survey, and this area varies between sites, affecting density calculations. If this estimate is of a population that had declined by 27% of the pre-disease population size, then the 2007 population (estimated to have declined by 64%) would be 10,000 mature individuals.<br/><br/>For both estimates, the potential error is high and still under discussion. The estimation of mature individuals is particularly subject to error since the disease has so reduced the proportion of older individuals: in disease-free sites, half of all individuals trapped are typically mature, but this proportion is much less in diseased sites (varying locally according to time since disease emergence). Acknowledging these provisos, the best estimate of total population size based on current evidence thus lies within the range of 10,000-25,000 mature individuals.<br/><br/>While Tasmanian Devil distribution across the state appears to be continuous, two management units have been identified, with devils in north-western Tasmania being genetically distinct from those found across the rest of the State (Jones <em>et al</em>. 2004; Farmer 2006).<br/><br/><strong>North-western</strong>. Jones <em>et al</em>. (2004) identified a genetically distinct management unit in northwestern Tasmania, across approximately 13,400 km², west of the Forth river and south to Macquarie Heads (Farmer 2006). This region encompasses four sites intensively surveyed by the Devil Disease Team since 2004, and one surveyed by C. Hawkins (unpubl.) in 2003. One of the Devil Disease Team sites, Woolnorth, holds the highest population density of Tasmanian Devils found in any of the Team's surveys, which is more than double that at the other sites. Extrapolating from the resulting density estimates, this management unit may currently consist of between 3,000 and 12,500 mature individuals. This management unit is not currently declining, but DFTD is expected to continue to spread into it.<br/><br/><strong>Eastern/South-western</strong>. The remaining 50,630 km² area covers nine sites surveyed by the Save the Tasmanian Devil Program since 2004. The mean of the density estimates for each of these sites applied to this area (separating formerly high eastern areas and from long term low density southeastern areas as described above) indicates an approximate population size of 7,000 - 12,500 mature individuals. <br/><br/>Jones and Rose (1996) related statewide survey results to environmental and climatic features, generating a CORTEX spatial model predicting distribution and relative densities across the state (Figure 1). Findings from mark-recapture trapping surveys and other trapping work by the Department of Primary Industry and Water (DPIW) Save the Tasmanian Devil Program broadly support these predictions for DFTD-free regions. However, in central and eastern regions, marked population declines have been detected, in association with the earlier reports of Devil Facial Tumour Disease (DFTD) (Hawkins <em>et al</em>. 2006; McCallum <em>et al</em>. 2007), subsequent to the time of the Jones and Rose survey. The north-west region is thus now thought to support the highest population densities.<br/><br/>The general population trend for the entire species is a decline (McCallum <em>et al</em>. 2007; Hawkins <em>et al</em>. 2006; DPIWE, 2005).",Decreasing,"The Tasmanian Devil is found throughout mainland Tasmania, Australia, an area of 64,030 km<sup>2</sup>. The species disappeared from the Australian mainland 430 +/-160 years ago (Archer and Baynes 1972), possibly through competition with dingos (Guiler 1982) and Aboriginals (Johnson and Wroe 2003). Tasmanian Devils were introduced to the small offshore Badger Island in the mid-1990s, but as of August 2007 all Tasmanian Devils were thought to have been removed from this island (N.Mooney unpubl.).<br/><br/>Tasmanian Devils were present on Bruny Island (a large inshore island off south-eastern Tasmania) in the early 1800s, but there are no confirmed records from after 1900. Tasmanian Devils also occur on Robbins Island, a large inshore island to the north-west, semi-connected to mainland Tasmania.",,Terrestrial,"As of May 2008, the Tasmanian Devil is listed as Endangered under the Tasmanian Government's <em>Threatened Species Protection Act 1995</em>. It is also listed as Vulnerable under the Australian Government <em>Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999</em>. <br/><br/>At the end of 2003, the Tasmanian State Government's Department of Primary Industries, Water and Environment (now Department of Primary Industries and Water) launched the Tasmanian Devil Disease Program to investigate and respond to the threat of Devil Facial Tumour Disease. This program, now called the <em>Save the Tasmanian Devil Program</em>, has attracted many collaborative researchers. A forum exclusive to those directly involved in DFTD research in February 2007 was attended by approximately 80 people. The mission of the Save the Tasmanian Devil Program is ""to maintain the Tasmanian Devil as an ecologically functional species in the wild"" (AUSVET 2005). Conservation actions, including research directed towards improving conservation management, are driven by three future scenarios that have the potential to turn the epidemic around and bring devils back into the landscape as an ecologically functional species (Jones <em>et al.</em> 2007). These are extinction in the wild and reintroduction, the evolution of resistance, and the broad-scale application of a vaccine. Four management actions can therefore potentially be employed: establishing insurance populations; disease suppression in wild populations; selection for disease resistance; and development of a vaccine (McCallum and Jones 2006). Each of these is included in the current Strategic Plan of the Save the Tasmanian Devil Program.<br/><br/><strong>Insurance strategy</strong><br/>The highest priority is to establish insurance populations of healthy devils in places isolated from the disease, firstly to avoid total extinction and, secondly, as a source for reintroduction to the wild if devils, and therefore also the disease, become extinct. Because these populations will possibly carry the species for 25-50 years and because devils already have low genetic diversity, a conservative retention of genetic diversity of 95% is recommended (Jones et  al. 2007; Save the Tasmanian Devil Program Insurance Population Strategy 2007). A large founder base of 150 individuals is recommended, to be built up to an effective population size of 500 individuals. This would mean maintaining an actual population size of about 1700 individuals, if they were all maintained in captivity where breeding is closely managed, or 5,000 individuals if they were all wild-living (Jones et  al. 2007; Save the Tasmanian Devil Program Insurance Population Strategy 2007). <br/><br/>Insurance populations would ideally be managed as a metapopulation of multiple captive and wild populations with managed migration between populations to maintain genetic diversity (Jones <em>et al</em>. 2007). Maintenance of wild as well as captive insurance populations is important because wild-living animals retain natural behaviours and natural suites of parasites, pathogens and commensals, all of which are progressively lost in captive animals (Jones <em>et al</em>. 2007). The options for wild insurance populations are offshore islands, and fenced enclosures on mainland Australia and disease free areas on mainland Tasmania. There are a number of issues to be considered with these possible types of insurance populations, including the number of potential sites, the number of devils that could be held, balancing the conservation value of the sites for other purposes, ecological functionality, biosecurity risk, whether the site is currently disease-free or whether disease eradication would be required (see disease suppression below), cost of establishment and maintenance, stakeholders and timescale. <br/><br/>To date, there have been three intakes of founders for captive insurance populations from the wild: 26 devils from eastern (n=13) and north-western (n=12) genetic provenances in 2005, 25 north-western founders in 2007, and 63 north-western founders in 2008. Founders were collected from as wide a geographic area as assurity of disease-free status permitted at the time (established though intensive and extensive surveys and including a buffer zone). This intake area gets smaller each year as DFTD spreads, and is currently the north-west corner and a strip down the west coast. Founder devils were accepted for collection according to a strict set of protocols: recently weaned and likely to be pre-dispersal, no biting injuries and no signs of sexual maturity / oestrus in females. The first two intakes were maintained in quarantine in Tasmania for 20 months and 8 months, respectively, in facilities where there are no wild devils on the outside (e.g. suburban, island). The current intake will be maintained in quarantine for a shorter period. These founder devils are transferred to mainland zoos where they are managed by the Australasian Regional Association of Zoological Parks and Aquariums (ARAZPA).<br/><br/>A risk reduction document has been distributed to wildlife park operators and the zoological industry (DPIW 2005; Tasmanian Devil Facial Tumour Disease Management Strategy) outlining biosecurity measures to maintain the health of current captive populations. These measures include adaptation of husbandry protocols to include use of footbaths, employ appropriate waste disposal principles or secure enclosures to prevent contact between wild and captive Tasmanian Devils. Actions have been moderately successful in terms of increasing biosecurity at existing wildlife parks. An intra-state movement guideline was established requiring special permits to transfer Tasmanian Devils between parks.<br/><br/>Updates on the disease and quarantine protocols are regularly disseminated to all stakeholders. <br/><br/><strong>Disease suppression adaptive management trial</strong><br/>The only technique currently available to manage or even eradicate the disease in wild populations is detection and removal (euthanasia) of infected individuals. This comes lower in the decision tree than establishment of insurance populations (McCallum and Jones 2006), but is also part of an insurance strategy (McCallum and Jones submitted). If this technique works, it is a means of eradicating the disease in isolatable areas. If eradication is not achievable, disease suppression is still potentially a cost-effective way of protecting wild devil populations (per devil cost per annum of A$1,000 cf. A$12,000 to maintain a devil in captivity). Disease suppression has other uses as well, such as maintaining buffer zones around fenced enclosures and eradicating incursions (McCallum and Jones submitted).<br/><br/>An adaptive management trial in disease suppression commenced in January 2006 (after an 18-month pilot study) on the Forestier peninsula, where the disease has newly arrived and prevalence was low, and where movement of diseased Tasmanian Devils across a bridge and canal can be restricted. Work is underway with the state road authority and an engineering consulting firm to construct a barrier to devils on the bridge. Diseased Tasmanian Devils are being removed from the peninsula population through intensive trapping, in the hope of reducing or extirpating the disease there and to learn more about possibilities of controlling DFTD elsewhere. If it is not possible to eradicate or even control the disease in this isolated site, it is probably not possible to do so elsewhere. The suppression has succeeded in limiting the extent of the population decline, age structure changes and geographic spread and the size of the tumours now being detected is smaller (Jones <em>et al</em>. 2007, unpubl.). In late 2006, the rate of transitions to new disease cases peaked and prevalence is now in decline (Lachish <em>et al</em>. in prep.). It is too early to say whether eradication is possible (M. Jones unpubl.).<br/><br/><strong>Selection for resistance </strong><br/>Research is in progress to identify resistant genotypes, in the MHC gene complex associated with tumour recognition (Siddle <em>et al</em>. 2007), and in the peri-centric inversion in chromosome 5 (Pearse and Swift 2006). If resistant individuals are found, management could be directed towards artificial selection in captive or wild populations, or in translocating resistant individuals to depleted parts of the devil's range.<br/><br/>Current evidence suggests that lack of diversity at the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) is responsible for the disease being able to transmit between devils (Siddle <em>et al</em>. 2007). There is evidence that some individuals from the as yet uninfected West Coast have MHC profiles that differ from those found in the infected Eastern populations (Belov pers. comm). Whether these differences are sufficient to be protective is currently unknown, but it is an area of active research.<br/><br/><strong>Vaccine and treatment research</strong><br/>Vaccine research is ongoing and potentially promising, but is expected to take many years to achieve success. To be effective for disease control in wild populations in Tasmania, much of which is rugged and inaccessible by vehicle, a vaccine would need to be orally delivered, preferably by aerial baiting.<br/><br/>Research into treatment using cytotoxic drugs is underway. Treatment could be a viable option for saving captive individuals with valuable bloodlines but is too intensive and expensive to ever be useful for conserving wild populations (Stephen Pyecroft pers. comm. in Jones <em>et al</em>. 2007).<br/><br/>Currently, approximately 40% of the state of Tasmania is protected, but this is unlikely to counter the effects of DFTD.",Australasian,,false,false,Global

Brice <em>et al</em>. (2012) found that it avoids complex vegetation structure at the habitat and microhabitat scale. In some studies it becomes less common after significant rainfall increases vegetation cover (Woolley 1984; Owens 1997). It has been found sheltering in logs and stumps, beneath saltbush tussocks and spinifex (<em>Triodia</em>) hummocks and in deep cracks at the base of shrubs. It also shelters in other animals’ burrows including those of trapdoor spiders, hopping-mice, agamid lizards and goannas. In captivity it has been observed to dig shallow burrows and cover the entrance with grass. A burrow excavated in northern South Australia was 500 mm long and only 50 mm deep, making it vulnerable to damage by vehicles or stock. Brice <em>et al</em>. (2012) located five burrows in gibber habitat in spring by radio-tracking; four were of narrow diameter and shallow, only slightly larger than the body of the occupying Kultarr, and one was apparently an abandoned burrow of a larger animal.

They are agile hunters and can leap as much as 2 m between tree branches or trunks. During the day they shelter in tree hollows. Home range in females can typically be 20-40 ha, while male home ranges may be &gt;100 ha; however, home range can be much smaller in high quality forest (van der Ree <em>et al</em>. 2001). Diet is predominantly invertebrates found on or under bark; nectar is also taken, appearing to be a particularly prized but rare and patchy food source (Scarff <em>et al</em>. 1998).</p>    <p>Rhind (1996) found that, in forests of south-western Australia, Brush-tailed Phascogales used hollows in mature and dead Jarrah <em>Eucalyptus marginata</em> and Marri <em>Corymbia calophylla</em>. Rhind (1996) also found that logging practices of the time removed most habitat trees. Competition for nest hollows from other species that nest or shelter in hollows, including the introduced Honey Bee <em>Apis mellifera</em>, may be limiting (van der Ree <em>et al</em>. 2006). </p>    <p>Rhind (2002) reported that, in south west Australia, habitat quality was correlated with body size and the largest phascogales were found in swamp/gully systems, suggesting food is a normally limiting resource for this species in this environment. Additionally, a significant decrease in growth rate occurred during a drought year, and growth of young seemed restricted during dependency. Maternal mortality appeared high during late lactation as orphaned, unweaned young were encountered in nest boxes. Subsequently, adult males were 25% less in mass than usual; females 15% less. Population decline followed with capture rates one-third of that typically found for the time of year. Recovery was not apparent until two years after drought. In this food-limited environment phascogale populations appear particularly vulnerable to annual fluctuations in rainfall.</p>",Past reduction in area of occupancy for this species has been predominantly caused by gross habitat alteration including continued habitat clearing and fragmentation. Habitat alteration as a result of logging and mining has also been detrimental to the species. The greatest current threat is predation by feral cats; the increasing decline in the availability of hollow-bearing trees is also a threat. Predation by the red fox is also a threat. Male die-off immediately after breeding makes this taxon particularly vulnerable to stochastic events. Reproductively viable populations require large areas of suitable habitat in order to persist because male home ranges are often greater than 100 hectares (Soderquist and Rhind 2008).,"There are no robust estimates of population size, or that of subpopulations. Although males may often enter traps during the breeding season (Cuttle 1982), Brush-tailed Phascogales do not enter conventional traps readily most of the time, making estimates of abundance difficult. More surveys using other detection techniques and non-conventional traps, such as nest boxes, are required. It is likely that they occur sparsely but discontinuously across their extensive range.",Decreasing,"<p>The Brush-tailed Phascogale originally occurred in most of south-western Australia, the extreme south east of South Australia, much of Victoria, coastal and near coastal New South Wales, coastal and near coastal Queensland, and the higher rainfall part of north-western Kimberley.

An ongoing continuing decline is demonstrated by the recent loss of several subpopulations. It occurs naturally on two very small islands and, on the mainland, it survives naturally only in Fitzgerald River National Park. It has been introduced (assisted colonisation) to another small island, and has been reintroduced to one mainland location.</p>","<p>Dibblers are semi-arboreal and mainly crepuscular. They once occupied a variety of habitats. Mainland occurrences of Dibblers have been characterised by the presence of long-unburnt heathland. This generalisation applies to records from Cheyne Beach, Torndirrup National Park and most records from Fitzgerald River National Park. Typically, captures have been on sandy substrates although occasional records are on laterite soils (Baczocha and Start 1996; Barrett 1998). Vegetation structure is the feature providing most similarity between capture sites and Baczocha and Start (1997) suggested that Dibblers ‘...seem to prefer vegetation with a dense canopy &gt;1 metre high which has been unburnt for at least 10 years’. Dense vegetation may be preferred because it supplies abundant invertebrate prey, or it may provide protection from predation by foxes and cats, or both. In 1996, however, Dibblers were captured in an area that had been burnt seven years previously, but this was in an area that had been baited for foxes for several years (Friend 2004). Extensive fire has been a frequent occurrence in Fitzgerald River National Park over the few decades and the subpopulations within the Park are small and fragmented.</p>    <p>A study of the habitat preferences of island Dibblers (Bencini <em>et al</em>. 2001) found that on Boullanger Island there was no significant difference between trap success in low-closed heath, foredune heath, open scrubland and sword sedge <em>Lepidosperma</em> sp. thicket. On Whitlock Island, significantly greater capture rates were recorded in dunal scrubland and foredune heath than in succulent heath. On Boullanger and Whitlock Islands, a study has shown that diet consisted of c. 20% plant material with the remainder being invertebrates. Scat analysis showed that Dibblers consumed at least 10 orders of invertebrates ranging in length from 0.1 mm to 25 mm with an average size of 4.5 ± 0.4 mm. The Dibblers did not select for a particular size or taxon of prey, but fed on any invertebrates that were readily available to them. This suggests that Dibblers are essentially insectivorous dietary generalists and opportunists (Miller <em>et al</em>. 2003). Boullanger and Whitlock Islands have often-dense populations of the introduced House Mouse <em>Mus musculus</em>. Boullanger Islands has a subpopulation of <em>Sminthopsis griseoventer</em> (see conservation summary for the Boullanger Island Dunnart). <br/></p><p><br/></p><p>Concern that <em>Mus</em> was depressing Dibbler numbers led to their introduction to Escape Island (Moro 2003). A study of the feasibility of eradicating the mice has been carried out (Friend <em>et al</em>. 2009) and the Dibbler Recovery Team is overseeing a project aimed at carrying out the eradication (J. Friend <em>pers. comm</em>.). Mills <em>et al</em>. (2006) found that the Boullanger and Whitlock Island subpopulations had low levels of heterozygosity and high levels of inbreeding compared with mainland populations. The Whitlock Island Dibbler subpopulation appears to have been founded by animals from Boullanger Island, but founder effects and isolation have resulted in two genetically distinct subpopulations. There is evidence of some genetic exchange, but only as a rare event.</p>","Introduced foxes and cats are known to prey on this species, and are found throughout its known mainland range, though they are not present on the islands. The plant disease <em>Phytophthora cinnamomi</em> is a threat to Dibblers, as it adversely alters their habitat. Introduced mice are also a potential threat on Boullanger and Whitlock Islands, due to competition (Friend 2004). Because this species is dependent on habitat that has not been recently burned, frequent and intense fire is a major threat.","<p>McCulloch (1998) estimated the total population of both Boullanger and Whitlock Islands to be c. 180 animals, but there has been considerable decline since then (J. Friend <em>pers. comm</em>.). Abundance data for the mainland are not available, but the total number of mature individuals is likely to be &lt;1000. The rate of decline may have been reduced recently because of two successful translocations and intensive fire and predator management at some mainland subpopulations, however the population size is likely still to be decreasing because of diminishing habitat quality due to inappropriate fire regimes, <em>Phytophthora</em> and predation at mainland locations (J. Friend <em>pers. comm</em>).</p>",Decreasing,"<p>The Dibbler once occurred widely with subfossil records suggesting a range from Dirk Hartog Island (Shark Bay) and the Zuytdorp Cliffs north of Geraldton, near Jurien, to Peak Charles (130 km north east of Esperance) and east to the Eyre Peninsula, South Australia. Early specimens, all from Western Australia, came from Moore River (near today’s New Norcia), Wanneroo, near Kojonup, King George Sound (Albany) and ‘Salt River’ (Pallinup River, 100 km north east of Albany) (Ride 1970; Maxwell <em>et al</em>. 1996; Friend 2004). </p>    <p>Long thought extinct, the Dibbler was rediscovered at Cheyne Beach, east of Albany, in 1967 (Morcombe 1967). Since then specimens have come from Torndirrup National Park (Smith 1990), Arpenteur Nature Reserve (Cheyne Beach), Waychinicup National Park, near Jerdacuttup (Woolley 1977) and Fitzgerald River National Park (Muir 1985; Chapman and Newby 1995; Friend 2004; Sanders <em>et al</em>. 2012). Currently, the only known natural mainland subpopulations are in Fitzgerald River National Park. In 1985 it was discovered on Boullanger (31 ha) and Whitlock (5 ha) Islands in Jurien Bay (Fuller and Burbidge 1987); genetic differentiation between these two island populations indicates that there is little interchange between them (Mills <em>et al</em>. 2003) and they are regarded as separate subpopulations. Dibblers were introduced to Escape Island (11 ha), Jurien Bay, in 1998-2000 (Moro 2003), and reintroduced to Peniup Nature Reserve (2001) and Stirling Range National Park (2004) (Friend 2008).

Monitoring at Peniup Nature Reserve and on the Jurien Bay Islands is carried out as funding permits. Regular aerial baiting for fox control is conducted in Fitzgerald River National Park as part of ‘Western Shield’. Aerial baiting is also carried out at Waychinicup National Park. Operational feral Cat control is not yet possible. Boullanger and Whitlock Islands are regularly visited and Escape Island sometimes visited by recreational boat users from Jurien; educational information is provided at boat ramps and Department of Environment and Conservation (DEC) staff check the islands regularly. Eradication of the House Mouse populations from the islands is proposed. Fire management in Fitzgerald River National Park is carried under the Fitzgerald River National Park Management Plan (Moore <em>et al</em>. 1991), which recognises the needs of Dibblers and other threatened fauna requiring long-unburnt vegetation, including Western Bristlebirds <em>Dasyornis longirostris</em> and Western Ground Parrots <em>Pezoporus flaviventris</em>. Fire management of Peniup is carried out by DEC’s Albany District and is aimed at keeping most of the reserve in a long-unburnt state, while recognising the concerns of neighbouring landholders. The Turquoise Coast Island Nature Reserves Draft Management Plan 2004 (CALM 2004) prescribes total fire exclusion from the islands and lays out a rapid response procedure to extinguish wildfire if it occurs. Fitzgerald River National Park has small areas of infestation by <em>Phytophthora</em> and there is ongoing work to control it and prevent its spread. A captive breeding colony is maintained at Perth Zoo and supplies &gt;50 animals of mainland stock for translocation each year. It is regularly supplemented with Dibblers from the wild. The large increase in young produced in 2010 at Perth Zoo was due to a new pairing and weaning technique, which so far has proven to increase the output of the colony whilst keeping husbandry costs constant. A translocation to the Stirling Range National Park failed and a mainland translocation is under way to the 380 ha Waychinicup National Park enclosure (mainland island) built for Gilbert’s Potoroos <em>Potorous gilbertii</em>. The Malleefowl Preservation Group is involved in monitoring the subpopulation at Peniup and other community volunteers assist with the monitoring of the Jurien Bay island subpopulations. There has been considerable research carried out mainly through The University of Western Australia, elucidating aspects of genetics and the ecology of the Dibbler and other vertebrates on the islands where it occurs.</p><p>  </p><p>Since rediscovery in 1967, there have been numerous searches for Dibblers on the mainland, often without success, even at locations where specimens had been obtained opportunistically (e.g. Woolley and Valente 1982). Discovery of relatively abundant island subpopulations in 1985 led to several studies on the species’ biology and ecology, captive breeding (Lambert and Mills 2006) and an introduction to Escape Island, which is free from introduced mammals. Discovery in Fitzgerald River National Park in 1984 led to further studies, captive breeding and translocations.</p>    All areas where Dibblers are known to occur are conservation reserves managed by the Western Australian Department of Environment and Conservation, which conducts ongoing research and management of the Dibbler. In areas occupied by Dibblers, management focuses on maintaining significant areas of long-unburnt habitat and preventing the spread of <em>Phytophthora</em> dieback. Volunteers are involved in translocations and monitoring. Current management aligns to actions in the Recovery Plan (Friend 2004).<p></p>",Australasian,,false,false,Global

Between the 1930s and 1960s, Finlayson (1961) noted that mulgaras (including this species, in part) were ‘everywhere much reduced’ across large segments of central Australia; and on the basis of documentation of Aboriginal knowledge across central Australia in the decades leading to the 1980s, Burbidge <em>et al</em>.

However, in at least the north of South Australia the distribution and (probably) population size of the species has increased substantially in association with decline in European Rabbit numbers due to the spread of rabbit calicivirus, which has evidently had the effect of reducing the abundance of Red Foxes and feral cats (Pedler <em>et al.</em> 2016).</p>",Stable,"<p>The Crest-tailed Mulgara has (or had) a wide distribution across central and inland Australia.

Occurs in lower abundances in progressively more marginal habitat - in lower altitude notophyll and mesophyll habitats (Maxwell <em>et al.</em> 1996). Occasionally it occurs as a transient in wet and dry sclerophyll forest and in modified habitats (e.g., pastures).","The reasons for decline of <em>D. m. maculatus</em> are a combination of habitat loss and fragmentation, possible disease at the beginning of the 20th century, competition with foxes and feral cats, predation by foxes and dogs, and impact of widespread strychnine baiting for dingoes. Most recently threats include non-target mortality from trapping and poisoning (there is a long-standing concern that quolls are being killed by the use of 1080 poisoning, but this has not been confirmed and is currently the focus of a number of investigative trials). Direct persecution is significant as they are attracted to caged birds and do not necessarily take flight when discovered. Estimated forest loss as a result of clearing within its former range in south-east Queensland is over 70%, with the majority of loss occurring over the last 20 years. The species uses a large number of den sites throughout the year and activities that reduce the number of den logs are likely to be significant. In Tasmania this taxon is naturally rare, possibly as a result of competition with <em>D. viverrinus</em>, <em>Sarcophilus harrisii</em>, and feral cats (Jones 1995). Road mortality could be a significant factor where high speed roads and good habitat coincide, as quolls are attracted to feed on the carcasses of road-killed animals (Maxwell <em>et al.</em> 1996).<br/><br/><em>Dasyurus m. gracilis</em> is susceptible to factors which increase juvenile and/or adult mortality, or which otherwise decrease breeding success. Such factors may include habitat clearance, logging, introduced species including cane toad, and direct killing at chicken pens, at houses, and on roads (Maxwell <em>et al.</em> 1996).","The total population of Spotted-tailed Quolls is estimated to be very approximately 14,000 mature individuals; local declines have been observed or suspected across much of the range, but the rate of overall decline is not considered likely to be greater than 30% (Woinarski, Burbidge and Harrison 2014).

By inference from the decline observed in <em>Dasyurus</em> species in Australia, most significantly in its closest relative <em>D. geoffroii geoffroii</em> (a subspecies that is now presumed extinct) and <em>D. g. fortis</em> (the subject of major recovery efforts), it is plausible that this species is also undergoing continuing decline.

Feral cats have not been recorded previously in the Trans-Fly region. The impact of cats on this species is unknown, but one specimen obtained by Woolley was killed by a cat (P.

Earlier mammal surveys in the region, including those of the 1936-37 Archbold expedition (Rand and Brass 1940) and Jentink (1907), did not find it. Four specimens were collected by P. A. Woolley in 1991 (Woolley 2001). Seven weeks of targeted trapping with between 100 and 150 traps per night in the Trans-Fly in 2006 (at both Mibini and Serki) resulted in only 12 records of this species, eight of which were captured in traps; the other four were obtained from local hunters (S. Hamilton pers. comm.).",Unknown,"<em>Dasyurus spartacus</em> is the only mammal in New Guinea (Indonesia and Papua New Guinea) restricted to the Trans-Fly ecoregion in the southern part of the island that cannot also be found in Northern Australia (Helgen and Oliver 2004).

Monitoring of subpopulations by trapping confirms a continuing decline, except that abundance remains relatively high on Bruny Island.<br/><br/>The Eastern Quoll may be detrimentally affected by feral cat predation (especially if cats have increased, or increase in the future, following the severe decline of the Tasmanian Devil <em>Sarcophilus harrisii</em>), and dogs, land-use changes and road mortality. A severe impact on this species is projected if the Red Fox were to become established in Tasmania, but it is unlikely that foxes will become abundant, and hence quolls substantially reduced, within a 10-year timeframe.&#160;</p>","<p>The Eastern Quoll is largely solitary and is nocturnal and only occasionally forages or basks during daylight. It is found in a variety of habitats including rainforest, heathland, alpine areas and scrub. However, it prefers dry grassland and forest mosaics which are bounded by agricultural land, particularly where pasture grubs are common (Jones <em>et al</em>. 2013, DPIPWE 2012). During the day, animals sleep in nests made under rocks, in underground burrows or fallen logs. The Eastern Quoll is an opportunistic carnivore that takes live prey and scavenges. It is an impressive hunter, taking mammals such as rabbits, mice and rats, and small elapid snakes and skinks. They sometimes scavenge morsels of food from around feeding Tasmanian Devils <em>Sarcophilus harrisii</em>. However, the main component of its diet at lower altitudes is invertebrates, especially agricultural pests such as the cockchafer beetle and corbie grub. In alpine areas, invertebrates form a small component of the diet; carrion and some fruits are also eaten (Blackhall 1980, Godsell 1983, Jones and Barmuta 1998, DPIPWE 2012).<br/><br/>Feral cats are well suited to taking quolls, as well as the prey that quolls eat. Predation and direct competition potentially force the Eastern Quoll from its natural habitat. Feral cat numbers may have increased in Tasmania coinciding with the rapid decline of the Tasmanian Devil, which are hypothesised to have depressed feral cat numbers (Fancourt 2011, Hollings 2012, Hollings <em>et al</em>. 2013). However, feral cats have been present in Tasmania for many decades and quolls have survived.<br/><br/>Dogs, road kills (Jones 1993), and, mostly in the past, illegal poisoning or trapping are additional causes of mortality, but population level effects are unknown. Red Foxes are a future threat. Jones <em>et al</em>. (2004) reported that Eastern Quolls lacked an appropriate anti-predator response to foxes, suggesting that they would be vulnerable to predation by foxes. The Red Fox may now be present in Tasmania (Berry <em>et al</em>. 2007, Sarre <em>et al</em>. 2012, DPIPWE 2013) and experience on mainland Australia shows that, if Red Foxes establish, fox predation will have a severe, possibly catastrophic impact on this species in the medium- to long-term.</p>","The threatening processes that caused the decline and extinction of Eastern Quoll on the Australian mainland are unknown, but disease, together with predation by introduced feral cats (<em>Felis catus</em>) and Red Foxes (<em>Vulpes vulpes</em>) are the most likely causes (Peacock and Abbott 2014).<br/><br/>In Tasmania, the recent decline has been linked to a sustained period of unsuitable weather conditions over much of the species' distribution (Fancourt <em>et al. </em>2015).&#160;Predation by feral cats is considered the most likely process preventing the species' recovery: juveniles are vulnerable to cat predation (Jones <em>et al</em>. 2014), and cat abundance might be increasing due to the decline of the Tasmanian Devil (<em>Sarcophilus harrisii</em>) (Fancourt 2011).&#160;However, feral cats have been present in Tasmania for a long time and quolls have survived.&#160;<br/><br/>There have been previous episodes of severe rates of mortality associated with disease (Wood Jones 1923, Guiler 1961, Green 2007) that may have made a significant contribution to local extinction on the mainland; some ongoing incidence and (mostly uncertain) impacts of diseases (e.g. toxoplasmosis; however, Fancourt <em>et al</em>. (2012) found toxoplasmosis does not appear to be contributing to recent population declines).<br/><br/>The Red Fox recently arrived in Tasmania; if it establishes, it is likely to be a major threat through predation. Minor threats include poisoning and trapping, predation by dogs and road mortality.","<p>There is no robust assessment of population size, or that of individual subpopulations. Annual spotlight surveys, originally designed to monitor trends in the abundance of wallabies and possums, have been conducted in Tasmania between 1985 and 2011 by the Department of Primary Industries, Parks, Water and Environment (Driessen and Hocking 1992, DPIPWE 2012, M. Driessen and G. Hocking <em>pers. comm.</em> 2014), with the number of transects increased to 132 following a review by Southwell and Fletcher (1990). Further transects were added between 1985 and 1990 with 150 transects being surveyed annually since 1990, with a core group of 42 transects being surveyed every year from 1975 to 2011; spotlighting methodology was standardized in 1985.<br/><br/>Analysis by Fancourt <em>et al</em>. (2013) of spotlight surveys from 147 sites across Tasmania revealed a 52% reduction in the number of Eastern Quoll sightings over the 10 years to 2009. Declines of 61-100% were observed in trapping surveys at three study sites compared with trapping conducted 18-31 years earlier. A reduction in trap success was recorded in five of six non-target surveys, with declines of 51-100% over 1-12 years. Recent spotlight surveys do not reveal any recovery (B. Fancourt <em>pers. comm. </em>2014). While trapping surveys tend to confirm the decline on the Tasmanian mainland, numbers captured on Bruny Island increased between 2010 and 2012 (B. Fancourt <em>pers. comm.</em> 2014). However, this subpopulation is presumed to be far smaller than that on the Tasmanian mainland, meaning that the species’ overall population trend is likely to be ongoing decline.</p>                 <p></p>",Decreasing,"The Eastern Quoll was previously widespread in mainland southeastern Australia including New South Wales (NSW NPWS 1993), Victoria (Menkhorst 1995) and eastern South Australia (Jones 2008). It became extinct on the mainland <em>c</em>. mid-1960s (Menkhorst 1995, Jones 2008, DPIPWE 2012), with sightings at Kew and Ivanhoe, Melbourne until the early 1960s, maybe later (P.

The species is most abundant (and apparently with less fluctuations) in rocky environments. In north Queensland, it is most common in coastal and/or high altitude rocky areas and in drier habitats of upland tablelands (Maxwell <em>et al.</em> 1996). This species is a generalist, as it occurs in a wide range of habitats and its diet consists of a variety of invertebrates and small vertebrates (Woinarski 2005). The Northern Quoll shelters in hollow logs, rock crevices, caves, and tree hollows (Woinarski 2005). It is mostly a ground-dwelling species, but is also an adept climber (Woinarski 2005).","Current threats are uncertain, but the species may be vulnerable to disease, possibly related to the presence of cats. Cats and dogs are known to kill individuals, although they apparently do not like to eat them. Predation is the main cause of mortality in some areas (exacerbated by changes in fire regimes that result in more frequent burning), particularly woodland and forest habitats (Maxwell <em>et al.</em> 1996). There have been recent substantial population declines in the Iron Range (Queensland), Cape York Peninsula, and the top end of the Northern Territory associated with the spread of cane toads and land-use changes. For instance, major declines to regional extinction have been reported for Northern Quolls following cane toad invasion on Cape York Peninsula (Burnett 1997). Northern Quolls appear to be particularly susceptible to the poison of cane toads, and are killed when they attempt to kill or consume the toads (Woinarski 2005). The species has also disappeared from coastal lowland areas in north Queensland following agricultural and urban development (Maxwell <em>et al.</em> 1996).","The species is locally common, although it currently is undergoing declines across much of its range. Densities of 3-4 females per square kilometre in savannah woodland have been recorded (Oakwood 2002). Several studies suggest that there has been a recent, severe population decline in Kakadu National Park due to cane toads (Watson and Woinarski 2003, Oakwood 2004). This species is common in north-western Kimberley, particularly in near-coastal, high-rainfall areas (A. Burbidge pers. comm.).",Decreasing,"The Northern Quoll occurs in the northern parts of Australia. Historically, it occurred in northern Australia from Pilbara to south-east Queensland, extending inland as far south as Alexandria. More recently, there has been substantial decline in southern and eastern Queensland and the Cape York Peninsula.

A substantial decline has also occurred in Pilbara (Maxwell <em>et al.</em> 1996). The species has been recorded from Groote Eylandt and the nearby North-east Island, Marchinbar Island (in the Wessel group), Inglis Island (in the English Company Islands group) and Vanderlin Island (Sir Edward Pellew group).

The species is assessed as Near Threatened because it is conservation dependant. The conservation programs that focus on the species are, primarily, fox-control via baiting that is carried out over conservation lands in the south west of Western Australia (WA) by the WA state government. This benefits the chuditch along with other terrestrial mammals within the prey-size range of the red fox. In addition, populations of the chuditch have been established by translocation in other localities where ongoing management excludes foxes or hold densities of foxes at low levels</p><p></p>","<p>Chuditch utilized a wide variety of habitats including woodland associations, dry sclerophyll forests, beaches and deserts (Burbidge <em>et al</em>. 1988; Serena <em>et al</em>. 1991; Orell and Morris 1994). In the Jarrah forest, Chuditch populations occur in both moist, densely vegetated, steeply sloping forest and drier, open, gently sloping forest. Riparian vegetation appears to support higher densities of Chuditch, possibly because the food supply is better or more reliable, and better cover offered by dense undergrowth may reduce vulnerability to predators. Chuditch also appear to utilise native vegetation along road reserves in the wheatbelt. </p>    <p>Chuditch are nocturnal and generally solitary and can move several kilometres in one night. Serena and Soderquist (1989) estimated the home range in jarrah forest to be 337 ha, with a core area of 90&#160;ha. In more arid habitats larger home ranges are apparently required (Rayner <em>et al</em>. 2011). Within the core area up to 180 den sites, located in hollow logs, tree limbs, rock outcrops and burrows, were utilised. In the arid zone, Chuditch are known to have denned in termitaria and holes in the ground, including warrens constructed by Boodie <em>Bettongia lesueur</em> (Johnson and Roff 1982; Burbidge <em>et al</em>. 1988). At Kalbarri National Park, Chuditch are at greatest density in the gorges along the Murchison River.</p>    <p>The Chuditch is a generalist predator and an opportunistic hunter, eating small mammals, birds, reptiles, invertebrates and some plant matter. Large invertebrates comprise two-thirds of their diet. They will scavenge carrion and rubbish and prey on chickens (Soderquist and Serena 1994).</p>    <p>The enormous decline in range of the Chuditch since European settlement has been attributed mainly to predation by the European Red Fox <em>Vulpes vulpes</em>. However, in many areas, Chuditch abundance and distribution declined before the arrival of the fox with the pattern of pre-fox decline being consistent across multiple geographic regions, albeit poorly documented (T. Soderquist <em>pers. comm</em>.). The apparently rapid collapse of populations may have been due to multiple factors such as predation by an expanding feral Cat population, widespread use of strychnine baits to control Dingoes, an undocumented disease, habitat modification by livestock or changed fire regimes. Foxes arrived in the south west of Western Australia in the late 1920s. Before widespread fox control, using dried meat baits with 1080, was implemented in conservation lands in the south west, research demonstrated that baiting did not affect adult Chuditch and that following fox baiting, Chuditch numbers increased. At Batalling, trap success increased after fox baiting from c. 0.5% in December 1990 to 13% in July 1995 and has was then maintained at 4-6% (Morris <em>et al</em>. 2003).</p>    The Chuditch occurs in several national parks; however, the majority of its range is within State forest subject to multiple use including timber harvesting. Morris <em>et al</em>. (2003) studied the impact of timber harvesting at Kingston. Despite confounding data due to increasing numbers of Woylies <em>Bettongia penicillata</em> captured in traps set for Chuditch following fox control, they concluded that logging had little or no effect on Chuditch abundance. The jarrah forest is also subject to rotational prescribed burning and monitoring has shown little impact on Chuditch.",Predation by introduced Red Fox and feral Cat are the major threats.,"<p>At European settlement, the Chuditch was relatively abundant across its extensive range (Collett 1887, cited in Serena <em>et al</em>. 1991; Whittell 1954; Johnson and Roff 1982; Burbidge <em>et al</em>.1988), but declined rapidly from the early nineteenth century.</p>    <p>In the 1980s, the Chuditch population was estimated to be &lt;6000 (Serena <em>et al</em>. 1991), including an estimated c. 2500-4400 in the jarrah forest (based on trapping records from 1974-1988). However, numbers are now higher due to fox control and translocations, but in 2008 may still have been &lt;10&#160;000 (Morris <em>et al</em>. 2008). However, Groom and Morris (2009) estimated that there were 12&#160;500 Chuditch in the jarrah forest, and 2000 Chuditch in the wheatbelt and Goldfields. Isolated subpopulations may be small, e.g. &lt;100 at Julimar (Morris <em>et al</em>. 2008).</p>    At Forrestiana (80 km east of Hyden) with a mean annual rainfall of 340 mm, population density was estimated at 0.039 individuals km<sup>-2</sup>. This was almost three times lower than the lowest density estimate in jarrah forest sites, which was from Dwellingup at 0.11 individuals km<sup>-2</sup> and was substantially smaller than the densities estimated at Batalling, at 0.34 km<sup>-2</sup> and Julimar, at 0.68 km<sup>-2 </sup>(Rayner <em>et al</em>. 2011).",Stable,"<p>The Chuditch was formerly distributed over nearly 70% of the continent, occurring in every mainland State and Territory.

However, a drastic decline and contraction of range has occurred since. Specimens were last collected in New South Wales in 1841, Victoria in 1857 and in Queensland between 1884 and 1907. Chuditch were last reported in the arid zone in the mid-1950s (Finlayson 1961); western desert Aboriginal oral history reported that it survived until about 1950 (Johnson and Roff 1982; Burbidge <em>et al</em>. 1988). In Western Australia, the species was still abundant in the south-west in 1907, but had disappeared from coastal areas north of Geraldton by this time (Shortridge 1909).

It occurs in a variety of habitats and, while it fluctuates in some habitats due to vegetation successional change, there is no evidence of extreme fluctuations, it has not declined in extent of occurrence and there is no compelling evidence of an ongoing population decline.</p>","<p>In Tasmania, the White-footed Dunnart is widely distributed in most vegetation types including sclerophyll forest, heath and rainforest at altitudes up to 810 m, but is infrequently recorded (Rounsevell <em>et al</em>. 1991; Lunney 2008). In Victoria, it occurs in a range of habitats including coastal tussock grassland and sedgeland, wet heath, and forest or woodland with a dense (&gt;50% cover) heathy understorey or mid-story vegetation (Menkhorst 1995). In New South Wales its habitat includes heathy woodlands and forest, coastal scrub and coastal dune grassland. There it has been recorded in early- to mid-successional vegetation and in post-fire and post-logging coastal forests (Morton <em>et al</em>. 1980; Lunney 2008). In north Queensland, the species has been recorded only occasionally and records are from mature or regenerating notophyll vine forest at altitudes of &gt;750&#160;m.<br/><br/>In the Otway Ranges of southern Victoria, it has been recorded in regrowth 4-16 years post-fire (Wilson and Aberton 2006). In New South Wales a study found that it bred in disturbed habitat but did not persist when the vegetation regrew and became dense (Lunney and Ashby 1987). Another study (Lunney and Leary 1989) found that females occupied small home ranges, and capture sites did not overlap with those of other females. Males did not have exclusive capture sites and the home ranges overlapped. Their movement patterns fell into two groups: explorer males and resident males. The largest movement of an explorer male was 1025 m in 24 hours. It was concluded that suitable habitat, such as recently disturbed forest, may occur naturally only as disjunct and temporary patches, hence the ability to travel long distances enables this species to utilise these suddenly abundant and transient resources and that the pattern of habitat selection identified showed the White-footed Dunnart to be ecologically distinct from the other species of small mammals in the forest and thus in need of special consideration in management programs (Lunney and Leary 1989; Lunney <em>et al</em>. 1989). However, in Victoria, the evidence for a preference for disturbed sites or regenerating vegetation is less clear (Menkhorst 1995).<br/><br/>White-footed Dunnarts prey on a wide variety of invertebrates of up to 18 mm in length, including skinks of up to 1.5 g. They nest in tree hollows, and under logs and strips of bark (Lunney 2008).<br/><br/>In New South Wales and Victoria, mating occurs in late July and August. Up to 10 young are born, occupying the rudimentary pouch until eight weeks of age when they are left in a nest and suckled for a further month (Lunney 2008). In Tasmania breeding commences in early spring, young being carried in the pouch during September and October (Green 2007). White-footed Dunnart females appear to have only one short breeding season during their lifetime and males apparently do not survive to breed in a second year (Menkhorst 1995). Longevity is up to 2.5 years (Jones <em>et al</em>. 2009), but is probably less on average in the wild. Generation length is here assumed to be one year.</p>",This is an early-mid successional stage  post-fire and post-logging species. Inappropriate fire regimes may result in some declines. Logging may affect abundance in the short term. Predation by feral cats and Red Foxes may be an issue but data are lacking.,"<p>The total population is suspected to be fewer than 10&#160;000 mature individuals, with fewer than 1000 in New South Wales, fewer than 2000 in Victoria, and probably fewer than 5000 individuals in Tasmania (Lunney <em>et al</em>. 2008); however, these figures are not based on statistically valid projections from sampling and given the recent detections by camera traps in Victoria (P. Menkhorst <em>pers. comm</em>.), the widespread occurrence in Tasmania and five offshore islands plus difficulty in detecting the species, the Tasmanian figure, at least, is likely to be an under-estimate. The Queensland subpopulation is represented by only a very few specimens, and its size there is unknown but likely to be low (Lunney <em>et al</em>. 2008). Subpopulations in Victoria and New South Wales undergo fluctuations in abundance due to habitat successional change (Lunney 2008) but there is little evidence that the population size ‘varies widely, rapidly and frequently, typically with a variation of greater than one order of magnitude’. There is no information concerning fluctuations in Tasmania or its offshore islands.</p>",Stable,"<p>The White-footed Dunnart occurs in Tasmania (except the south west), southern Victoria, and far south-eastern New South Wales, with a highly disjunct subpopulation in the Wet Tropics of north Queensland. In Victoria it occurs along the coastline and in adjacent plains and foothills and extends inland along some major river valleys (Menkhorst 1995). It occurs on five Tasmanian offshore islands: Bruny (367 km<sup>2</sup>&#160;ha), Cape Barren (462 km<sup>2</sup>), Clarke (84 km<sup>2</sup>) and West Sister (7.1&#160;km<sup>2</sup>); it has been introduced to East Sister Island (5.2 km<sup>2</sup>) (Abbott and Burbidge 1995).

21947794,20293,Sminthopsis psammophila,Vulnerable,"B2ab(ii,iii,v); D2",2016,2014-03-17 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p>The range of the Sandhill Dunnart has declined greatly in the past and it continues to decline. In recent times it has been located in three widely separated areas, two in the Great Victoria Desert and one on Eyre Peninsula. The calculated area of occupancy (AOO) is &lt;500 km<sup>2</sup> (which meets criteria for Endangered), however, because of the large, remote area between known localities, and the necessarily low survey effort in this region, we assume a larger AOO but &lt;2,000 km<sup>2</sup>. The species occurs at &lt;10 locations, and there is an inferred decline in area of occupancy, area, extent and quality of habitat, and number of mature individuals. Long-term occupancy is not assured even at sites where it has been previously detected.</p>","<p>With males weighing 26-55 g (mean 36 g) and females 25-42 g (33 g), the Sandhill Dunnart is the second largest member of the genus <em>Sminthopsis</em> and marginally lies within the ‘critical weight range’ (Burbidge and McKenzie 1989); terrestrial mammals within that range have an elevated likelihood of extinction or significant decline, especially in arid areas.<br/><br/>Sandhill Dunnarts occupy sandy semi-arid and arid parts of southern and central Australia, often with sand dunes, where the vegetation is dominated by spinifex <em>Triodia</em> spp. hummock grassland. A study on Eyre Peninsula found Sandhill Dunnarts commonly nested in large spinifex hummocks that had started to die off in the centre. They entered these spinifex hummocks by leaping up onto the hummock and climbing over the needles to the centre before scrambling down through the central portion of dead leaves. In the centre of the hummock they built a circular depression or space within the dead spinifex needles. Adult female dunnarts occasionally dug burrows; starting from inside the spinifex the burrows spiral down under the plant. These burrows were up to 90 cm long and had a small terminal chamber that contained nesting material of leaves and shredded bark. Male Sandhill Dunnarts were found to use a greater variety of nest sites than females, including small burrows between spinifex clumps, hollow logs, and Mitchell’s Hopping-mouse <em>Notomys mitchellii</em> burrows (Churchill 2001). In the Great Victoria Desert, both sexes tend to build burrows, from 30 cm to 1 m long, under spinifex hummocks (Pearson and Churchill 2008). Sandhill Dunnarts have relatively large home ranges of up to 7.5 ha. They can move rapidly over long distances, with individuals being recorded moving up to 1,960 m in two hours (Pearson and Churchill 2008).<br/><br/>In Yellabinna Regional Reserve, monitoring between 2008 and 2012 demonstrated a tenuous relationship between spinifex height (but not cover, size or continuity) in an area of dunes where capture rates are seemingly higher than elsewhere in Yellabinna (with sparser parallel dunes) (Ward 2008). However, spinifex height has been comparable at other locations where capture rates are lower and in areas where no Sandhill Dunnarts were found in surveys. The area of jumbled dunes may coincide with appropriate topography or underlying hydrology that allows for greater productivity and food abundance (M. Ward <em>pers. comm</em>. 2014). Alternatively, the large area of continuous habitat and relatively thick spinifex cover may allow Sandhill Dunnarts to more effectively evade introduced predators.<br/><br/>Diet consists of a wide variety of small to medium-sized invertebrates, mainly ants, beetles, spiders, grasshoppers, wasps and centipedes (Pearson and Churchill 2008).<br/><br/>The species’ shelter behaviour, inside spinifex hummocks or in burrows, would limit predation by feral cats and red foxes; however, they would be prone to predation while foraging. Extensive, hot, summer fires, which are now common in the central spinifex deserts, are a significant threat as they destroy habitat over very large areas, limiting reinvasion as the vegetation recovers. Frequent fire is also a threat, as Sandhill Dunnarts require old spinifex hummocks in which to shelter. Future threats could include the spread of invasive Buffel Grass <em>Cenchrus ciliaris</em> which has replaced many grasslands further north and has recently invaded the Sandhill Dunnart’s range.<br/><br/>Sandhill Dunnarts appear to have a seasonal but extended breeding period and are able to reproduce from late winter to autumn (Lambert <em>et al</em>. 2011; A. McLean <em>pers. comm</em>. 2014). At the Middleback Range, Eyre Peninsula, South Australia, the breeding season commenced with mating in August, females with up to eight pouch young were observed in September/October and juveniles were observed dispersing in January (McLean <em>et al</em>. 2012).</p>  <p>&#160;</p>","Major threats are predation by feral cats and Red Foxes, and inappropriate fire regimes (more extensive and frequent). A minor threat is habitat loss and fragmentation, but this occurs within only a small part of the range.","<p>There is no robust estimate of population size. When subpopulations have been located, local abundance can vary highly between years. Early analysis of the subpopulation in north-west of Yellabinna Regional Reserve has indicated that abundance is not solely related to spinifex height or cover, however these factors are likely to be important in combination with habitat productivity. Repeated trapping in South Australia has demonstrated resident populations in the Great Victoria Desert and areas of Eyre Peninsula. Trapping in one location in Yellabinna has retrapped two female dunnarts both within 200&#160;m of the original location, one after one year and one after two years (Ward 2008). Subadults are routinely captured on the Eyre Peninsula during summer but adult captures are extremely variable.<br/><br/>Captive colonies are held by Moonlit Sanctuary Wildlife Conservation Park, Victoria, and Alice Springs Desert Park, Northern Territory (Ford and Hogg 2012).</p>",Decreasing,"<p>The Sandhill Dunnart was first collected near Lake Amadeus in the Northern Territory in 1896, but has not been recorded in the Northern Territory since. There was a gap of 75 years before the next records, which came from the Eyre Peninsula in South Australia (Aitken 1971). Later it was discovered in Western Australia (Hart and Kitchener 1986; Pearson and Robinson 1989). Since then it has been recorded in a small number of widely-separated localities in the Great Victoria Desert in South Australia and Western Australia as well as on Eyre Peninsula. Churchill (2001) provides a list of known records to 2001. Surveys between 2008 and 2012 across the Great Victorian Desert (including Yellabinna Regional Reserve and widespread locations across Maralinga Tjarutja Lands) suggest that in the Great Victoria Desert Sandhill Dunnarts are now restricted to the mallee spinifex of Yellabinna Regional Reserve, in particular the north west portion of this reserve. Up until 2012 this area probably represented the stronghold for the species across Australia. However, recent wildfires (2012) burnt a large proportion of the known range in Yellabinna Regional Reserve. Whilst populations may recover over time, this will be dependent on appropriate recovery conditions.<br/><br/>Recent survey work has recorded the species in the following areas of the Eyre Peninsula: Hambidge Conservation Park, Ironstone Hill Conservation Park, Secret Rocks, Munyaroo Conservation Park and Pinkawillinie Conservation Park. However, capture rates are generally low and dependent on the fire age of vegetation.</p>",,Terrestrial,"This species is listed on Appendix I of CITES. <br/><br/>Parts of the range of the Sandhill Dunnart are reserved as national park, nature reserve or equivalent; however, threatening processes operate similarly within non-reserved and reserved areas. In Yellabinna Regional Reserve in the Great Victoria Desert, prescribed burning on the perimeter of the primary habitat has been implemented in order to provide protection from large uncontrolled wildfire. Unfortunately, this proved insufficient. On the Eyre Peninsula, Red Fox and feral Cat control, Goat and European Rabbit control and fire management are being implemented across 500 km<sup>2</sup> of suitable habitat where Sandhill Dunnarts are regularly recorded (Middleback Alliance (Ecological Horizons 2012), K. Moseby and J. Read <em>pers. comm</em>. 2014). Fire management of other reserves, especially Pinkawillinie Conservation Park, is also designed to promote patchy regeneration of <em>Triodia</em> and prevent broad-scale wildfires in order to safeguard Sandhill Dunnart subpopulations.",Australasian,,false,false,Global

It also qualifies as Vulnerable under category B, because it has a highly restricted and fragmented Area of Occupancy where there are known threats.</p>","<p>The Numbat’s original habitat was variable ranging from Mulga (<em>Acacia aneura</em>) woodland and sand plain and sand dune areas dominated by spinifex <em>Triodia</em> spp. hummock grassland in the arid zone (Friend <em>et al</em>. 1982, Burbidge <em>et al</em>. 1988) to eucalypt woodlands and forests in south-west Western Australia (Friend 1989). Unusually for an Australian marsupial, it is diurnal and this exposes it to predation by raptors such as Wedge-tailed Eagles <em>Aquila audax</em>, Brown Falcons <em>Falco berigora</em>, Little Eagles <em>Hieraaetus morphnoides</em> and Brown Goshawks <em>Accipiter fasciatus</em>, as well as reptiles such as the monitor <em>Varanus gouldii</em> and the Carpet Python <em>Morelia spilota</em> (Calaby 1960, Friend 1986). Introduced predators, Red Fox <em>Vulpes vulpes</em> and feral cat <em>Felis catus</em>, coupled with widespread land clearing in southern parts of its range, are the major causes of its decline.</p>    <p>The Numbat’s diet is primarily termites, with some ants, apparently ingested accidentally (Friend 1989). Subsurface termite galleries are located by smell and dug out with both front feet. The long tongue is then flicked in and out gathering the exposed termites (Calaby 1960). Observations on a captive specimen by Fleay (1942) indicate that 15 000 to 20 000 termites are required by an adult animal each day.</p>    Numbats seek overnight refuge in hollow logs, tree hollows and burrows, which provide protection from predators. Cooper and Withers (2005) found that occupied night refuges were on average 5°C warmer than ambient temperature, which would result in considerable energy savings, and that burrows had higher insulation than logs or tree hollows, and had more constant night temperatures and higher minimum temperatures.","The introduction of the predatory Red Fox and feral cats has had a profound impact and continues to be a major threat today (Friend 2008). Changed fire regimes, especially in arid grasslands and habitat destruction in some areas is a concern (Maxwell <em>et al.</em> 1996). Raptors (native species whose numbers are often elevated in fragmented woodlands) are a known threat. Frequent fires can be a threat due to the reduction in the number of logs, which the species uses as shelter.","<p>Numbats occur at low density and numbers fluctuate. Numbats were fairly common in the south-west of Western Australia in the 1950s (Calaby 1960) but numbers were very low by the late 1970s, probably only c. 300 individuals in total (Friend 2010). Numbers increased in Dryandra after foxes were controlled, to an estimated 600 in 1992, but again declined to c. 50 in 2007 (Friend and Burbidge 2008). Research carried out in 2011-12 showed that feral cats are now the main predator of Numbats in Dryandra (J. Friend pers. comm.). At Perup, Numbats also declined in the 1970s (Christensen <em>et al. </em>1984, Friend 1990) but the population recovered under fox control and the distribution expanded, with a current local area of occupancy of &gt;1,000 km<sup>2</sup> (J. Friend<em> </em>pers. comm.). Translocations have met varying success, with some failing (e.g. Karroun Hill Nature Reserve, Dale Conservation Park, Karakamia Sanctuary) and others resulting in self-sustaining populations (Boyagin, Batalling, Yookamurra, Scotia). Friend (2010) estimated that there are &lt;1,000 mature Numbats in the wild and &lt;250 mature individuals in the largest subpopulation.</p>",Decreasing,"<p>The Numbat once occurred over much of southern semi-arid and arid Australia from the west coast of south-western Australia eastwards though the western deserts (Calaby 1960, Finlayson 1961, Burbidge and Fuller 1978, Friend <em>et al</em>. 1982, Burbidge <em>et al</em>. 1988, Peacock 2006) into southern Northern Territory (Woinarski <em>et al</em>. 2007), much of South Australia, western New South Wales and north-western Victoria (Friend 2008). It was apparently absent from the Karri <em>Eucalyptus diversicolor</em> forest of south-western Australia and from the Nullarbor Plain, although there is a late Pleistocene fossil record from Madura Cave (Lundelius and Turnbull 1978, cited in Friend 1989). Burbidge <em>et al</em>. (2009), using modern, historical and subfossil data, found that Numbats occurred in 11 of Australia’s 85 bioregions and that they became extinct in all but one.</p>    <p>By the 1970s, Numbats had disappeared from most of their range, surviving only in small areas of south-western Australia (in the northern jarrah forest, Swan coastal plain, Dryandra near Narrogin, Boyagin near Brookton, Tutanning near Pingelly, bushland south of Hyden, and Perup, east of Manjimup). By the 1980s, many subpopulations were lost (Friend 2010), leaving only the Dryandra and Perup subpopulations. In the mid-1980s, experimental fox control at Dryandra demonstrated that the near removal of foxes resulted in a rapid increase in Numbat numbers (Friend 1990). At that time, some Numbats were taken into captivity at the Department of Environment and Conservation’s Western Australian Wildlife Research Centre where they bred successfully (Friend and Whitford 1986, 1993). Some of these animals were transferred to Perth Zoo, which has maintained a captive colony since, and supplied many Numbats for reintroductions (Power <em>et al</em>. 2009).</p>    <p>Numbats have since been reintroduced to several sites in south-western Australia. They survive at Boyagin Nature Reserve (reintroduced 1985) and Batalling State Forest (1992). Initially successful reintroductions to Tutanning Nature Reserve (1989), Dragon Rocks Nature Reserve (1995), and Stirling Range National Park (1998) are currently under assessment since serious declines have been recorded. The most recent new translocation has been to Cocanarup Timber Reserve (near Ravensthorpe) commencing in 2006. Translocations to Karroun Hill Nature Reserve (1986), Dale Conservation Park (1996) and a fenced area, Karakamia Sanctuary (1994), were unsuccessful (Friend and Thomas 1994, 2003). Numbats have been translocated to two fenced mainland islands in eastern Australia from which Red Foxes and Cats have been removed: Yookamurra Sanctuary (South Australia, 1994) and Scotia Sanctuary (New South Wales, 1999, Viera <em>et al</em>. 2007).</p>    During a trial translocation of five Numbats to the ‘Arid Recovery’ mainland island (Roxby Downs, South Australia) in 2005, three were taken by raptors, with two surviving 18 months after release (Bester and Rusten 2009). A further translocation is proposed (Friend 2010).",,Terrestrial,"The Numbat is listed as a threatened species under Australian law.

Fire management to minimise widespread wildfire is also carried out, and silviculture guidelines for Numbat habitat are under development. Genetic variability within and between the Dryandra and Perup populations was studied by Fumagalli <em>et al. </em>(1994). Tissue samples are collected from all Numbats handled for comparison of subpopulations. Since the 1994 plan was written, translocations have been carried out or continued to Karroun Hill, Tutanning, Batalling, Yookamurra, Karakamia, Dragon Rocks, Dale Conservation Park, Stirling Range National Park, Scotia and Cocanarup, as well as a trial translocation to the Arid Recovery mainland island at Roxby Downs, South Australia. At least four of these translocations have resulted in self-sustaining populations, with three more yet to be thoroughly assessed. A captive colony was established at Perth Zoo in 1986 and reliable output of young commenced in 1993 (Power <em>et al</em>. 2009). Until then all translocations had sourced animals from Dryandra but in that year the subpopulation there crashed due to resource limitation, disease and possibly Cat predation. Subsequent translocations have relied significantly on captive-bred stock, with supplementation from wild populations (Boyagin, Yookamurra and Scotia). A raptor awareness program has been instituted at Perth Zoo to prepare captive-bred young for release. A community action group, Project Numbat, has been established in Perth and works with the recovery team to increase awareness of the Numbat and its plight, as well as raising significant funding to support Numbat recovery.</p><p></p><p>  </p><p>The Numbat is Western Australia’s mammal emblem and has been the subject of intensive research and management since c. 1980. The Western Australian Department of Parks and Wildlife (DPaW) and its predecessors have conducted research into Numbat ecology and the effect of introduced predators, managed sites where Numbats occur and conducted several translocations. Most areas in which Numbats occur in Western Australia are conservation estate managed by DPaW, which conducts regular fox control by aerial and ground baiting on &gt;3,000,000&#160;ha of land it manages in the south west.

Fragmentation of subpopulations is increased by the impacts of predation by red foxes, which restricts quokkas to patches of dense vegetation and inhibits dispersal between patches. Many surviving subpopulations may therefore not be viable over the long term, and the original metapopulation structure has collapsed. Significant projected loss of extent of occurrence (EOO) and area of occupancy (AOO) due to climate change, mainly a continuing reduction in winter rainfall, has been predicted","<p>In the northern jarrah forest, Quokkas are closely associated with tea-tree <em>Taxandria linearifolia</em> swamps with a mosaic of trees at differing ages as determined by fire (Hayward <em>et al</em>. 2007, de Tores 2008). In the southern jarrah forest, Quokkas occupy a wider variety of forest, woodland and wetland types including Jarrah <em>Eucalyptus marginata</em>, Marri <em>Corymbia calophylla</em>, Karri <em>E. diversicolor</em> and Tingle <em>E. jacksonii</em> or <em>E. guilfoylei</em>, and sedge-dominated riparian habitats (K. Bain <em>pers. comm</em>. 2008). Family groups exhibit overlapping home ranges that reflect a general non-territoriality. In the northern jarrah forest, Quokkas require a mosaic of habitat, including recently-burnt and long-unburnt <em>Taxandria</em> stands, and they do not utilize stands burnt 15-19 years previously (Christensen and Kimber 1975, de Tores <em>et al</em>. 2007). As swamps mature they become suboptimal, forcing Quokkas to colonise new patches. Since the collapse of the metapopulation following the arrival of the Red Fox in the 1930s, Quokkas have been forced to remain at a site because predation inhibits dispersal (Hayward <em>et al</em>. 2004, 2005a).</p>    <p>de Tores <em>et al</em>. (2004) reviewed Quokka research and conservation to that date. They noted, so far as the northern jarrah forest subpopulations are concerned, that despite six years of fox baiting, Quokka populations in the northern jarrah forest had not shown a pattern of increase (Hayward <em>et al</em>. 2003). However, a recent study has shown recovery of subpopulations in the northern jarrah forest after some years of fox baiting (Dundas <em>et al</em>. 2012).</p>    <p>Quokkas occur as many small, isolated subpopulations, many of which are within State forest subject to multiple use including timber harvesting. They remain in such areas despite more than 100 years of logging, but the effects of such disturbance are poorly understood. The Department of Environment and Conservation has developed adaptive management guidelines for management of such areas (Burrows and Liddlelow 2005) and validation of rapid assessment techniques has recently been completed. Along the south coast, Quokkas inhabit swamps, riparian areas, incised gullies and dense heaths. On Rottnest Island, they are found in all vegetation types, sheltering in low scrub (Nicholls 1971; Kitchener 1972, 1982). The biology of Rottnest Island Quokkas has been widely studied (Bradshaw 1983). On Bald Island Quokkas are widespread.</p>","Island populations fluctuate, but appear stable over the long term. Predation by red foxes and possibly feral cats has led to a past decline of mainland populations. Fox control has led to an increase in numbers in some areas. Feral pigs are causing habitat degradation and excluding Quokkas from swampy areas. Inappropriate fire regimes can lead to habitat degradation. Climate change leading to less rainfall is a current minor problem but is predicted to become severe.","<p>There are no robust estimates of overall abundance; de Tores <em>et al</em>. (2008) suggested that there may be <em>ca</em> 3,500-7,000 individuals on the mainland, 1,200-2,000 of which are along the south coast. It is abundant on Rottnest Island (4,000-8,000 individuals; Hayward <em>et al</em>. 2003) and Bald Island (500-2,000; de Tores <em>et al</em>. 2008). Many mainland subpopulations are thought to consist of only a few individuals (Alecs <em>et al</em>. 2003, Sinclair and Morris 1996). Is population size has declined substantially since European settlement, and is still declining.</p>",Decreasing,"<p>The Quokka is endemic to south-western Australia, including Rottnest (17 km²) and Bald (8 km²) Islands and, formerly, Breaksea Island (1 km², Abbott 2006). It was originally distributed from Moore River, 100 km north of Perth, through the higher rainfall part of the south-west, east along the south coast to at least the Green Range, 60 km north-east of Albany. Fossil deposits and historical records suggest that the Quokka originally occupied an area of approximately 41 200 km² in the south-western corner of Australia (de Tores <em>et al</em>. 2007). </p>    <p>Historical literature has shown that they were widespread and abundant when Europeans colonised the region in 1829, but a noticeable and dramatic decline occurred over the following century (Hayward 2002). This can be attributed mainly to the arrival of the Red Fox in the 1930s (Hayward <em>et al</em>. 2005a) and land clearing. There was another major contraction in the period 1980 to 1992, the cause of which is unknown, but it could be related to habitat deterioration, fox predation and declining winter rainfall. Overall range has contracted southwards with the northernmost records now in the Darling Range immediately east and north-east of Perth. The current extent of occurrence (EOO) was estimated as <em>ca</em> 17&#160;800&#160;km² by de Tores <em>et al</em>. (2007), but our calculation, using records since 1992 and including Rottnest Island, suggests it is larger than this. It persists patchily along the south coast east to the Green Range, including an isolated subpopulation in Stirling Range National Park. Quokkas are thought to be now absent from the Swan Coastal Plain, except for a recent record at Muddy Lakes, near Bunbury (Sinclair and Hyder 2009), although there have been two additional unconfirmed recent reports of presence (de Tores <em>et al</em>. 2007). Remaining subpopulations throughout much of current range are small and often isolated in the best habitat. They are severely fragmented because Red Fox predation greatly limits gene flow between mainland subpopulations.

However, the populations that are in the decline, such as in the Pilbara and those in central Queensland, require close monitoring.","<em>L. c. conspicillatus</em> occurs throughout Barrow Island and shelters in large <em>Triodia</em> hummocks (Burbidge and Johnson 2008; A. Burbidge pers. comm.).<br/><br/><em>L. c. leichardti</em> occupies a wide variety of habitat types including: open forests, open woodland, tall shrublands, tussock grasslands and hummock grasslands. In the central part of its range in Northern Territory, it particularly favours <em>Acacia shirleyi</em>/<em>Macropteranthes kekwickii</em> thickets (Lancewood/Bullwaddy) with an open understorey. In the drier southern parts of its range it commonly occupies spinifex (<em>Triodia</em> spp.) sandplains interspersed with low shrubs and a diversity of either soft grasses, sedges, or forb species. In the northern part of its range in Northern Territory and in Queensland it occupies open woodlands or open forests (generally <em>Eucalyptus</em> spp., <em>Erythrophleum chlorostachys</em>, <em>Terminalia canescens</em> or <em>Lysiphyllum cunninghamii</em>), with a tussock grass understorey. Predominant grass species in central and northern Queensland include <em>Themeda triandra</em>, <em>Bothriocloa ewartiana</em> and <em>Heteropogon contortus</em>. This species frequently feeds in areas regenerating after fire (Maxwell <em>et al.</em> 1996).<br/><br/>It is generally a solitary species, but up to three may be seen feeding together. Breeding occurs throughout the year. Young leave the pouch at about five months, and females become reproductively active at twelve months (Langford and Pavey 2002).","The reasons for decline of <em>L. c. leichardti</em> are probably many and varied in different parts of the range (Maxwell <em>et al.</em> 1996). There is little direct evidence to determine the exact factors, but these probably include introduced predators (foxes in southern parts of the range and possibly cats), and competitors, the pastoral industry (particularly sheep in the Pilbara and cattle in the central southern Kimberley and Queensland) and changes in fire regimes (central Australia). In central Queensland, intensive land use coupled with the effects of the long drought conditions has led to a decrease in the number of shelter sites (tussock grasses reduced in structure) and thereby increasing the probability of predation by dingoes (Maxwell <em>et al.</em> 1996). Here, too, the species seems to be stable where stocking rates are conservative: property sizes in the area are large enough to have flexible stocking rates and allow for paddock spelling. Fire is also used as a management tool – summer mosaic burns of which the stock and wallabies take advantage. Properties in the area have been managed in a constant manner for the last 60 years (Maxwell <em>et al.</em> 1996). In the Northern Territory, Spectacled Hare-wallaby populations seem secure in the belt of Lancewood/Bullwaddy woodland extending between 16<sup>o</sup> and 18<sup>o</sup> S. However, clearing of woodland for grazing, uncontrolled burning and logging of <em>Acacia shirleyi</em> forests are considered threatening processes for the species in this region (Langford and Pavey 2002).<br/><br/><em>L. c. conspicillatus</em> on Barrow Island has a limited range and is potentially threatened by the introduction of predators (e.g., feral cats).","This species is patchily distributed, but common in some parts of its range (uncommon elsewhere).

It is extinct from Hermite and Trimouille Islands, of the Montebello Islands (A. Burbidge pers. comm.).<br/><br/><em>L. c. leichardti</em> formerly occupied almost half of the Australian continent, and was found as far south as the MacDonnell Ranges (Northern Territory, 24°S) and Rockhampton (Queensland) (Maxwell <em>et al.</em> 1996). Its distribution is now extremely patchy. In Western Australia it is now rare and reduced to a few isolated populations in the Pilbara and Kimberley regions (very rare in the latter) (Maxwell <em>et al.</em> 1996). In Northern Territory it still occurs sparsely in the Tanami bioregion; near Newcastle Waters it is found in Acacia woodland, whereas near Borroloola in the Gulf Coastal bioregion it occurs in savannah woodland (Langford and Pavey 2002). It has disappeared from the southern-most parts of its range, now rarely occurring south of 21°S – a range contraction of more than 200 km. <em>L. c. leichardti</em> is common in suitable habitat between 16<sup>o</sup>-18<sup>o</sup> S (Maxwell <em>et al.</em> 1996). In Queensland it is widespread, recorded from Weipa on Cape York west to Dajarra and south to Rolleston near Rockhampton. Its extent of occurrence has not altered markedly in Queensland, although there is strong evidence of a marked decline in abundance in the south-eastern parts of its range (i.e, the central highlands area), and area of occupancy may have declined 20-30% due to broadscale clearing and development (Maxwell <em>et al.</em> 1996).",,Terrestrial,"The populations that are in the decline, such as in the Pilbara and those in central Queensland, require close monitoring to ensure that they do not decline in the future at a major rate.<br/><br/>There is no existing management program for the Spectacled Hare-wallaby in the Northern Territory (Langford and Pavey 2002). Management priorities for this region and others include: increase protection of vegetation types poorly represented in the reserve system (e.g., Lancewood/Bullwaddy thickets of Northern Territory, <em>Eucalyptus</em> woodland of northern and central Northern Territory and central Queensland); enter into protective agreements with landowners having populations of <em>L. c. leichardti</em> on their properties; determine locations, size and factors threatening populations, particularly in Western Australia and Queensland; more detailed ecological studies of the species e.g., habitat requirements, home range, dispersal patterns, social organisation, reproductive physiology, natural cycles in population size; determine response to different fire regimes and to different land management practices (e.g., grazing, clearing, burning, dingo baiting) in order to establish appropriate management techniques and conservation options, especially on pastoral land; assess current population densities and viability in different parts of the range; study effects of introduced predators (particularly cats and foxes) on population size and distribution; detailed study of population genetics required to clarify taxonomic status of various populations and extent of genetic variation within populations.

On Bernier and Dorre Islands they occupy the whole islands, but are more common in some vegetation types than others. In central Australia, they were widespread and abundant in hummock grass (<em>Triodia</em> spp.) deserts and also inhabited gravelly plains, dunes and mulga (<em>Acacia aneura</em>) low woodlands with tussock grass (Burbidge <em>et al</em>. 1988), sheltering in a scrape beneath spinifex hummocks or in a short burrow, especially during summer (Burbidge <em>et al</em>. 1988). Bolton and Latz (1978) considered the tight patchy burns created by Aboriginal people before European occupation to have favoured the species, and the generally large, mainly summer fires in recent years to have been a major reason for its decline.

Animals from this captive colony were established in a 1 km<sup>2</sup>-fenced site at the ‘mala paddock’ near Lake Surprise in the Tanami Desert.

An extensive search for hare-wallabies and other threatened desert mammals along salt lake chains in the Great Sandy Desert in 1988 failed to locate any Hare-wallabies (Burbidge and Pearson 1989). In 1998 there was a translocation of captive animals from the ‘mala paddock’ to Trimouille Island in the Montebello Islands off the Pilbara coast of Western Australia (Langford and Burbidge 2001); this subpopulation is thriving, and has supported a translocation to a fenced enclosure at Lorna Glen (DEC 2012).

The rate of decline is not well resolved, but suspected to be &gt;30% over a 21 year (=three generation) period. Hence it qualifies for listing as Vulnerable.","<p>The Brush-tailed Rock-wallaby is closely associated with rugged rocky areas, including rock faces and outcrops with boulders, ledges and caves (Short 1992; Menkhorst and Hynes 2011); however this association may be an artefact reflecting retreat from a far broader habitat distribution since European settlement (Menkhorst and Hynes 2011). The rocky sites now occupied may occur in a range of vegetation types including rainforests, eucalypt forests and woodlands (Eldridge and Close 2008). At night, Brush-tailed Rock-wallabies move from their daytime shelter sites to a foraging area, typically using a habitual route. Home range size varies from 6-30 hectares (Short 1992), although more recent radio-tracking data demonstrate that movements of c. 500 m distance per night are relatively common, suggesting home range sizes may be larger than previously published values (T. Soderquist <em>pers. comm</em>. 2014). Foraging areas may include forests, woodlands and pastures. The Brush-tailed Rock-wallaby has a mixed diet: grass is the main item, but flowers, forbs, leaves, fruit, bark and fungi are also eaten (Short 1989; Menkhorst and Hynes 2011).<br/><br/>The Brush-tailed Rock-wallaby lives in colonies, usually comprising fewer than 30 individuals (Piggott <em>et al</em>. 2006; Hazlitt <em>et al</em>. 2006a), with many colonies now comprising just a few individuals (Menkhorst and Hynes 2011). Habitat clearance and predation away from shelter sites lead to a decreased rate of successful dispersal between colonies, and increased risks of inbreeding impacts (Hazlitt <em>et al</em>. 2006b).<br/><br/>The Brush-tailed Rock-wallaby can breed throughout the year, although births peak from February to May (Eldridge and Close 2008), and at least in some colonies breeding may be highly synchronized (Wynd <em>et al</em>. 2006). Sexual maturity is reached at about 1.5-2 years (longer for males: Lee and Ward 1989). Longevity may reach at least 14 years (reported for the Jenolan subpopulation: T. Soderquist <em>pers. comm</em>.) (Jones <em>et al</em>. 2009); although the maximum recorded in the wild in studies of Victorian subpopulations is 8 years (L. Clausen <em>pers. comm</em>. 2014). Generation length is taken here as 7-8 years.</p><p></p>","There is a lack of data about the threats to the Brush-tailed Rock Wallaby (Eldridge and Close 2008). Predation by introduced foxes and competition with introduced goats are likely to be the greatest threats. Foxes prey on young rock wallabies and probably limit dispersal as well as recruitment. Introduced dogs and cats are also probably threats, but the habitat in which this species lives is not well suited to these predators. Habitat fragmentation and land clearance between colonies is also thought to limit dispersal and reduce numbers of individuals by exposing rock wallabies to higher rates of predation. As colony isolation increases so does the risk of inbreeding (Hazlitt <em>et al.</em> 2006a,b). <br/><br/>Hunting was perhaps the main historical factor in reducing the population and range of this species. A sustained commercially-driven period of hunting led to the decline of many populations and local extinctions, and may have been the primary cause of the initial decline, at least in central and southern New South Wales. Bounties were paid on over half a million rock-wallabies between 1894 and 1914 (Short and Milkovits 1990) and there was an extensive fur trade from pre-1890 to 1927 (Lunney <em>et al.</em> 1997). The species was also hunted extensively in the Grampians area of Victoria. The magnitude of hunting is apparent when one considers that the current population of the species is estimated at between 15,000 and 30,000 individuals, and in 1908 alone 92,590 skins were marketed by a single company (Lunney <em>et al.</em> 1997).","<p>In 2008, the population size was estimated to be between 15 000 and 30 000 individuals (DECC 2008), with most (80%) in north-eastern New South Wales, and far smaller proportions in central and south-eastern New South Wales (2%), south-eastern Queensland (17%) and Victoria (&lt;1%) (DECC 2008).<br/><br/>The population is declining, however the rate of decline is poorly resolved: Taggart <em>et al</em>. (2008) considered that the decline was ‘significant’ but &lt;30% over a 10-year period. Decline (and extirpation) is probably now inexorable at many to most of the smaller colonies unless these are intensively managed (by threat reduction and manipulation of genetic stocks). Mahon <em>et al</em>. (2011) reported on trends in 12 colonies in the Hunter-Central Rivers region of New South Wales from 2003 to 2011, with six of the colonies subject to intensive fox control, three colonies as unmanaged controls, and three colonies in more productive habitat and subject to wild dog control. There was no difference in population trends between treatments and a fitted regression model predicted decline in an abundance index (rock-wallaby pellets) of 58% over 10 years.<br/><br/>There have been many intensive monitoring programs for individual colonies (or groups of colonies) of Brush-tailed Rock-wallabies, and more broadly-based ongoing assessments of the persistence of larger groups of colonies (Dovey <em>et al</em>. 1997; DECC 2008). Eldridge <em>et al</em>. (2004) described the decline of a colony at Jenolan Caves from about 90 individuals in 1985 to seven individuals in 1992, probably due to predation. Monitoring at the two regional populations of Brush-tailed Rock-wallabies in Victoria demonstrated incremental loss of subpopulations and total population size, culminating in the extirpation of the Grampians population in 1999 (with subsequent trial reintroduction in 2008: Molyneux <em>et al</em>. 2011), and the persistence of only one subpopulation in eastern Victoria at Little River Gorge (Bluff <em>et al</em>. 2011)</p><p></p>",Decreasing,"<p>The Brush-tailed Rock-wallaby has a disjunct range in south-eastern Australia, mostly associated with the Great Dividing Range, from the Grampians in western Victoria to south-eastern Queensland (Yarramam, north of Toowoomba).

This hunting pressure may have been a primary factor in the historical decline (Taggart <em>et al</em>. 2008) and thence to the species’ vulnerability to other threats. At least 500 000 individuals were killed between 1894 and 1914, and almost 100,000 skins were marketed by a single company in one year (1908) (Lunney <em>et al</em>. 1997).

Roache (2011) provides a series of costed management and research actions aimed at recovering the species to Least Concern status. <br/><br/>There has been a substantial management effort devoted to the conservation of this species (Menkhorst and Hynes 2011).

It has been successfully introduced to Faure Island via several translocations (assisted colonization) between 2004 and 2012; this subpopulation is still establishing. All three island subpopulations are subject to plausible threats, especially the drying climate and introductions of exotic predators which would make it become Critically Endangered or even Extinct in a short time, hence it is listed as Vulnerable under criterion D2.</p>","<p>On Bernier, Dorre and Faure Islands the species shelters under dense thickets of <em>Acacia ligulata</em>, <em>A. coriacea</em> and <em>Alectryon oleifolius</em> on sandplains and <em>Diplolaena dampieri</em> and <em>A. oleifolius</em> on dunes. Beneath these shrubs, it forms runways. Several individuals may be found sheltering in one patch of shrubs, although adults of each sex appear to live in well-defined individual home ranges or territories. Feeding takes place at night in open areas. Grasses usually make up less than half the dietary intake with the remainder being composed of malvaceous and leguminous shrubs and other dicotyledons (Richards <em>et al</em>. 2001; Prince and Richards 2008). </p>","The current major threats to the subpopulations of the species include: the introduction of predators (feral cats and Red Foxes, dogs) to islands, destructive wildfire, and disease (Richards 2007). Introduced black rats and mice are also a concern, but to a lesser degree than the larger predators. Extreme fluctuations in populations on islands are a threat, but this threat is seen as minor relative to the risk exotic predators being introduced (Short <em>et al.</em> 1997). As extreme weather events become more common, and given that all locations for the species are nearby islands in Shark Bay, these fluctuations are a cause for concern as the area is predicted to continue to suffer reduced annual rainfall. The species presumably was extirpated from mainland Australia by a combination of&#160;predation by the Red Fox and feral cat and habitat disturbance.","Abundance on Bernier and Dorre Islands fluctuates greatly with rainfall. Surveys in 1988/89 indicated a total population of about 7700 animals, equally divided between the two islands (Short and Turner 1992), and 9700 in 1991/92 (Short <em>et al</em>. 1997). Recent surveys for this species estimated the number on Bernier Island as 1807 individuals and on Dorre Island as 2294 individuals (Reinhold 2010 in Roache 2011). Reintroduction attempts to Dirk Hartog Island and Peron Peninsula failed due to predation by the feral Cat and drought (Prince and Richards 2008). The first translocation to Faure Island, from which feral Cats have been eradicated, was in 2004, and was seven animals; these were supplemented every one to two years from the Peron captive breeding facility, as animals became available, in order to boost founder size numerically and genetically. To date 57 adults (plus 21 pouch young) have been introduced to Faure Island in eight translocations (S. Legge <em>pers. comm</em>. 2014).

There has presumably been significant habitat disturbance and reduction in habitat quality as a result of logging - although how resilient the species might be to these changes is unknown. New roads associated with petroleum and gas developments and logging have provide access to karst areas that were previously inaccessible. This increased access appears to have led to increased hunting pressure, as observed by T. Leary and attested by local landowners and others associated with the developments (T. Leary pers. comm. 2015). &#160;Development of roads in the area is continuing.","The Lowlands Tree Kangaroo is regarded by Flannery (995) as 'extremely rare', being known from only seven species.

As a result of this decline, total population size is now probably in the low hundreds. The cause of the recent decline is exploitation by local hunters. This has recently ceased in part of the species' distribution, the Torricelli Range, through a community-based conservation program run by the Tenkile Conservation Alliance. Preliminary evidence is that the decline of the Torricelli Range population has ceased in the last 5 years, and it is possible that this population may be starting to recover in response to protection from hunting. However the other population, in the Bewani Range, is not protected and is still subject to hunting. By inference this population, which is poorly surveyed, may be still in decline. It is not possible to say whether this decline offsets the recovery of the Torricelli population, but a conservative interpretation of the contrasting trends is that total population size is currently stable.","The species occurs in mid-montane tropical forest, typically containing&#160;<em>Podocarpous</em>, <em>Libocedrus</em>, <em>Auraucaria</em>, <em>Rapanea</em> and <em>Syzygium</em> species.

Unlike other tree kangaroos, this species spends a high proportion of time on the ground (Flannery 1995). Animals are wary and are usually only encountered as solitary individuals, although small groups were recorded in the past (Flannery 1995). There does not appear to be a breeding season, and the females seem to give birth to one, or possibly two, young (Flannery 1995).","This species is threatened by hunting for food by local people, and by habitat loss through conversion of forest to subsistence agricultural use and regional human population growth. Increased hunting associated with increased population density of people is responsible for severe decline of the&#160;Torricelli population, which may have been as low as 100 individuals in the 2000s. This represents a very substantial reduction of range and abundance in the memory of local villagers. <br/><br/>Since the establishment of the Tenkile Conservation Alliance in 2001 (www.tenkile.com), and the agreement by 50 villages within the range of the Torricelli population to cease hunting them, hunting pressure has dropped substantially and the species is effectively protected in that area. This has arrested the decline of that population which is evidently now beginning to increase (Jim Thomas pers. comm. 2015).<br/><br/>The population in the Bewani Ranges has not been surveyed. Possibly, the threat from hunting is lower for this populations because the human population in that area is smaller than in the Torricelli Range, but there are anecdotal reports that the Bewani Range population is subject to hunting.","The subpopulation size of this species in the Torricelli Mountains may have been as low as 100 individuals in the early 2000s (Jim Thomas pers. comm. 2015).

A recent study of the ranging behaviour of 15 individuals in upper montane forests (circa 3000 m asl) in the YUS Conservation Area found home range area was an average of 139.6 ±26.5 ha, with no difference between males and females. These home ranges are 40-100 times larger than those of Australian tree kangaroos or other rainforest macropods, possibly because of greater hunting impacts reducing density in PNG, and/or because of the comparatively much lower productivity of their high altitude habitat (Porolak <em>et al.</em> 2014).

The Huon Tree Kangaroo is threatened by overhunting by local people, habitat loss due to conversion of forest to subsistence agricultural use and general human encroachment.

The role of hunting and traditional knowledge is currently under investigation in the YUS Conservation Area by James Cook University and Tree Kangaroo Conservation Program researchers. </p>  <p>At higher elevations, forest wildfires caused by prolonged periods of drought is a major threat to these ecosystems. During an intensive El Niño event in 1997 a major wildfire destroyed upper montane forests in large parts of the Sarawaged and Finisterre Ranges, reducing favourable habitat in several regions. The impacts of climate change are likely to exacerbate this threat through increased frequency and/or intensity of such fires in the future.</p>","<p>Accurate estimates of the population size of the Huon Tree Kangaroo are difficult to make because of the species' naturally low population densities and the challenge of effectively surveying this cryptic species in its remote and mountainous range on the Huon Peninsula.

Huon Tree Kangaroos (and other macropods) were found at greater abundance within no-take zones and with lower hunting pressure. This is an encouraging finding given that most no-take zones in the region were established within only 2-10 years preceding the study (Ziembicki <em>et al</em>. 2012). Translating scat counts to reliable population estimates, however, is complicated by a lack of knowledge of scat production rates per individual and variability in decomposition rates (therefore detectability) of scats at different elevations.</p>  <p>A recent study of movements and&#160;home range&#160;of&#160;the species at 3000 m asl estimated densities of females at this elevation at one per 19.4 ha – an estimate far lower than for better-studied tree kangaroo species in north-eastern Australia (Porolak <em>et al.</em> 2014).

The number of locations is unknown but probably not substantially more than 10. The population size is &gt;10,000 mature individuals. There is no reliable assessment of trends in population size, but limited information provides weak (and inconsistent) inference of continuing population decline. Declines over last, or next three generation period are unlikely to approach 30%, so are insufficient to qualify for criterion A.</p>","<p>Lumholtz’s Tree-kangaroo is restricted mostly to rainforest habitats, but also extends along riparian vegetation through primarily open forest habitats, and less abundantly in wet sclerophyll forests along the western edge of the Atherton Tablelands (Kanowski <em>et al</em>. 2001a). <br/><br/>Lumholtz’s Tree-kangaroo is mainly nocturnal, but also intermittently active during daylight hours.&#160; Its diet mostly comprises foliage from a broad range of tree species and some vines, although Newell (1999a) noted that individual tree-kangaroos each used only a small set of plant species. It is predominantly arboreal.<br/><br/>&#160;Lumholtz’s Tree-kangaroos occupy some rainforest fragments (even fragments &lt;20 ha) (Laurance 1990, 1991, 1995, 1997; Laurance <em>et al</em>. 2008), although populations in such fragments may have limited long-term viability. Individuals can disperse through unsuitable habitat, but at such times may be particularly susceptible to predation by dogs, and to being killed by vehicles (Kanowski and Tucker 2002).<br/><br/>Climate change and associated factors have been predicted to have a major detrimental impact on this species, acting directly or indirectly through reduction in rainforest area, reduction in foliar nitrogen concentration, habitat degradation due to increased incidence of severe cyclones, increased incidence of high temperatures, and reduced incidence of free water in mist (Kanowski 2001, 2004; Kanowski <em>et al</em>. 2001; Winter 2004). Williams <em>et al</em>. (2003) predicted that increasing temperatures will result in the significant reduction of the core environment for this species.<br/><br/>&#160;Lumholtz’s Tree-kangaroos are mostly solitary within loose social groups, typically with one male and several females. In high quality habitat (fertile recent basalt-derived soils), males occupy home ranges of about 2 ha, which may encompass the non-overlapping and smaller (1-2 ha) ranges of several females (Newell 1999a; Johnson and Newell 2008). Site fidelity is very strong, with individuals reported to stay in their home range even if clearing or disturbance renders it unsuitable (Newell 1999bc).<br/><br/>Breeding is broadly seasonal, with females producing a single young, mostly during the wet season. Age to maturity is two years for females and 4.6 years for males (Johnson and Newell 2008).</p>","Historically, the main threat has been reduction of habitat, but this has ceased with the declaration of the Wet Tropics World Heritage Area, and the species appears to have been able to persist in the mosaic of fragmented habitat (particularly where there are available habitat corridors). On the Atherton Tableland, increased fragmentation makes them more vulnerable to predation by dogs, although strategic reforestation on the Atherton Tableland opens the possibility of some recovery of its original area of occupancy in the future (Maxwell <em>et al.</em> 1996). In agricultural areas where it occurs, predation by dogs and road kills represent threats. Climate change and associated factors have been predicted to have a major detrimental impact on this species, acting directly or indirectly through reduction in rainforest area, reduction in foliar nitrogen concentration, habitat degradation due to increased incidence of severe cyclones, increased incidence of high temperatures, and reduced incidence of free water in mist (Kanowski 2001, 2004; Kanowski <em>et al</em>. 2001; Winter 2004).","<p>Kanowski <em>et al</em>. (2001a) estimated that the 650 km<sup>2</sup> of high altitude rainforest (&gt;800 m a.s.l.) in the Wet Tropics World Heritage area supported 10,000 to 20,000 individuals, and this would represent the majority of the population.<br/><br/>Johnson and Newell (2008) considered it ‘sparse’. Winter <em>et al</em>. (2008) reported that it ‘is common in suitable habitat’. Densities are higher at elevations above 700 to 800 m. a.s.l. (Kanowski <em>et al</em>. 2001a, 2003). A maximum density of 1 individual/ha was reported across a set of 40 sampled rainforest sites in the Atherton Tablelands area, with mean abundance of&#160; 0.4 individuals per hectare (Kanowski <em>et al</em>. 2001b). Density is greater in forests on nutrient-rich basalt soils than on nutrient-poor acid igneous and metamorphic soils (Newell 1999c; Kanowski <em>et al</em>. 2001ab, 2003). In one rainforest regrowth fragment, on highly fertile basalt soils, Newell (1999a) reported densities of 1.4-1.5 individuals per hectare.<br/><br/>Winter <em>et al</em>. (2008) reported that its population size was stable. However, Laurance <em>et al</em>. (2008) reported a highly significant decline (of about 60%) in abundance in four intact rainforest sites sampled in 1986-87 and again in 2006-07, although this change may have been due to disturbance-related changes in forest structure and hence detectability (Laurance <em>et al</em>. 2008; R. Martin <em>pers. comm</em>. 2014). Kanowski <em>et al</em>. (2008) sampled nine intact forest sites in 1995-97 and again in 2006, six to eight months after Cyclone Larry had damaged vegetation at these sites, and reported a weakly significant trend for decrease in abundance across this sampling period, albeit with interpretation compromised by a small number of records for this species. However, abundance estimates based on spotlighting have some constraints due to low detectability (Newell 1999a; Martin 2005; R.

As a result it is prone to the effects of human activities or stochastic effects, such that it could become Critically Endangered or even Extinct within a short time period. However, over the last 10 years there have been no declines in abundance or occupancy of sufficient magnitude to justify listing as Endangered.","In the past, this species inhabited a wide range of vegetation types, generally characterized as dry woodlands, thickets and grassland. In its current limited distribution it shows a preference for transitional vegetation between dense <em>Acacia</em> scrub and eucalyptus open woodlands with grassy understory, and between pasture and young regrowth of Brigalow <em>Acacia harpophylla </em>(Evans 1992). It forages solitarily, mostly under tree cover, unless its food is scarce in dry times when it ventures further into open areas (Fisher 2000). It feeds at night, and shelters during the day in scrapes in dense thickets or in hollow logs (Fisher 2000). Young that have left the pouch but are still suckling remain hidden under low shrubs, in dense grass or in logs for most of the day and night. Dense ground cover is therefore essential for survival of juveniles (Fisher and Goldizen 2001).<br/><br/>Bridled Nailtail Wallabies feed on a high diversity of plants (&gt; 60 species) and show strong selection for plant species and plant parts of high nutritional quality and low fibre content. They feed on forbs, grasses and browse, in proportions that vary according to availability in different seasons. Forbs are generally selected for, and grasses selected against, especially during dry seasons when the diet also includes woody browse species (Evans and Jarman 1998).They can breed at any time of year, and in good conditions females may raise up to three young in a year (Lundie-Jenkins and Lowry 2005).","The species is threatened by introduced predators, the Red Fox and feral Cat especially; Dingoes or wild Dogs may also threaten small surviving population in unfenced sites. The impact of foxes is attested by the fact that the last surviving wild population (at Taunton) occupied a site at which foxes were absent. Populations introduced into a large fenced reserve at Scotia from which foxes and cats are excluded increased rapidly to high numbers, but subpopulations released outside those fences collapsed in the presence of low densities of foxes (S. Legge pers. comm. 2014). Modelling of the Taunton population demonstrated that predation of juveniles by feral Cats was sufficient to cause decline (Fisher <em>et al. </em>2000). Wild Dogs also appear to be a significant cause of mortality in that population&#160;(J. Augusteyn&#160;pers. comm.&#160;2014). Other threats include destruction of habitat, which probably contributed to historical declines, and degradation of habitat through invasion of introduced plants, especially Buffel Grass <em>Cenchrus ciliaris</em>. Drought is a cause of stochastic variation in population size, which could be critical for the three populations that have populations numbering in the hundreds or less.","Although the Bridled Nailtail Wallaby was reported to be a common animal at the time of European settlement (Lundie-Jenkins and Lowry 2005), its decline was rapid. The current total population size at unfenced sites is small. Recent (2011-2012) estimates of population size based on mark-recapture and transect counting are&#160;approximately&#160;90-130 individuals at Taunton and 100 individuals at Idalia (J. Augusteyn pers. comm. 2014; A. Horsup&#160;pers. comm.<em> </em>2014, D. Fisher&#160;pers. comm. 2014). Estimates using similar methods&#160;at Avocet&#160;were 30-40 in 2008 (Kinglsey <em>et al.</em> 2012) and 66 in 2012 (A. Horsup&#160;pers. comm.&#160;2014, D. Fisher&#160;pers. comm.&#160;2014).&#160;The area of occupancy at Taunton has declined considerably, from approximately 25 km<sup>2</sup>&#160;in the late 1908s to 4 km<sup>2</sup>&#160;currently (Wang and Fisher 2012). In 1985 the population at Taunton was estimated to be approximately 500 (Tierney 1985), and in 1991 was thought to be approximately 1400&#160;(Davidson 1991) though this might have been an overestimate (D. Fisher&#160;pers. comm.&#160;2014). The size of the Idalia population has fluctuated considerably. It was established in 1993 from a release of 275 individuals (Lundie-Jenkins and Lowry 2005), increased to approximately 400 individuals by 1999 (Pople <em>et al. </em>2001), then declined as a result of drought in 2002. In 2008 and 2011 the known minimum population size was 123 and 96 respectively (J. Augusteyn&#160;<em>pers. comm.</em>&#160;2014).<br/><br/>The population in the Australian Wildlife Conservancy's Scotia Sanctuary, where a fence excludes non-native predators, is the largest, consisting of approximately 2000 free-ranging animals, with a further 1500 in a captive breeding program (S. Legge pers. comm. 2014). The free-ranging animals are included in the overall population estimate as they are considered to be a viable and self-sustaining population established for more than five years. The Scotia population was established from 12 animals translocated in 1998, followed by further releases of 162 individuals in 2004-05.",Stable,"The Bridled Nailtail Wallaby was formerly spread over a large area that extended through inland regions of eastern Australia from south western South Australia to as far north as the base of Cape York Peninsula.

Predator control – A 20-km predator fence was built in 2002 to prevent a repeat of dingo predation that killed at least 15 wombats in 2000. Monitor and control competitors – The Eastern Grey Kangaroo is the major competitor for food and its numbers are being monitored. Habitat management – Introduced buffel grass is regularly slashed to promote green growth and native species. Fire management – Annual burns are undertaken to reduce fuel loads and promote plant diversity. Supplementary feed and water provisioning – Feed and water stations are now being used by wombats, particularly in dry times (Treby <em>et al.</em> 2007). Permanent management presence on Epping Forest National Park – A volunteer caretaker program ensures twice daily monitoring of the dingo fence.<br/><br/>2) Accurately monitoring wombats. Population censuses – Three censuses each year minimize disturbance and maximize the accuracy of the result and involve collecting wombat hair on sticky tape to extract DNA (see Banks <em>et al.</em> 2003). Burrow monitoring – This is undertaken every six months and monitors activity levels at burrows as an ""early warning system"". Trapping – This was the major means of censusing prior to development of the DNA technique and is now only undertaken when necessary (e.g., to attach radio-collars).<br/><br/>3) Translocation.

Animals live in colonies within extensive burrow systems. Each warren contains several animals (Taggart and Temple-Smith 2008). The species is long-lived (reaching more than 15 years in the wild) (Taggart and Temple-Smith 2008), and has a low rate of recruitment. Females are thought to be monogamous, and they produce a single young that lives in the pouch for six to seven months and is weaned after about a year (Taggart and Temple-Smith 2008). However, in drought years reproduction may cease and three consecutive years of ample rainfall are needed for there to be an increase in a population (Taggart and Temple-Smith 2008). Animals become sexually mature at about 3 years of age (Taggart and Temple-Smith 2008).","Presumably the range of the Southern Hairy-nosed Wombat declined through conversion of suitable habitat to agricultural land (in the past, for part of its range, though much of the current range is in pastoral lands). It is threatened by competition for grazing by domestic stock and introduced rabbits (Taggart and Temple-Smith 2008). Sarcoptic mange is now a major threat in the Murray Lands to the east; it kills 80-90 percent of affected populations/groups (Ruykys <em>et al</em>. 2009; Death <em>et al</em>. 2011). Wells (1995) noted that the seasonal pattern of productivity of annual and non-native plants does not coincide with the weaning period of wombat young, leading to high infant mortality.

21959641,16730,Petaurus australis,Near Threatened,,2016,2014-03-09 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Listed as Near Threatened because the few ongoing monitoring programs demonstrate decline in population size and/or area of occupancy that may approach 30% over a three generation period, because it is likely to face ongoing decline because of legacy impacts of habitat fragmentation, recent increases in land clearing in the Queensland parts of the distribution, and because habitat quality continues to be affected by inappropriate fire regimes and/or logging. For these reasons the species may be close to meeting the requirements for listing as Vulnerable under criteria A2bc+3bc+4bc.","<p>The Yellow-bellied Glider occurs in eucalypt-dominated forests and woodlands. Habitat suitability is determined in part by floristics, with a clear preference for forest types dominated by gum-barked and winter-flowering eucalypts (Kavanagh 1987; Eyre and Smith 1997; Eyre 2004), and with forest age sufficient to provide suitable trees for shelter and foraging (Milledge <em>et al</em>. 1991; Incoll <em>et al</em>. 2001; Eyre and Goldingay 2003). The Yellow-bellied Glider is reliant on large areas of mature forest (Milledge <em>et al</em>. 1991; Eyre and Smith 1997; Lindenmayer <em>et al</em>. 1999a; Incoll <em>et al</em>. 2001; Eyre 2002, 2004; van der Ree <em>et al. </em>2004).<br/><br/>The Yellow-bellied Glider is social, with pairs or larger family groups (of varying age and sex composition) occupying an exclusive large home range (30-65 ha: Henry and Craig 1984; Craig 1985; Goldingay 1992; Goldingay and Kavanagh 1993). Consequently it needs large forest blocks in order to maintain population viability. Home range sizes need to be large because foraging substrates are widely dispersed and are variable through space and time (Goldingay 2000). Microhabitat preferences of Yellow-bellied Gliders may change seasonally according to patterns of flowering, bark-shed and availability of other food resources (Kavanagh 1984). In south-eastern Queensland, Eyre (2002) considered that forest fragments needed to be at least 320 km<sup>2</sup> in order to be occupied by Yellow-bellied Gliders; and more generally Goldingay and Possingham (1995) considered that forest areas needed to be 180-350 km<sup>2</sup> to retain viable populations. It does not persist in smaller fragments now isolated by clearing or pine plantations (Lindenmayer <em>et al</em>. 1999b).<br/><br/>The impacts of fragmentation are particularly pronounced because of this species’ apparent incapacity to traverse extensive tracts (i.e. longer than gliding distance) of cleared land. The Yellow-bellied Glider can forage in tall regrowth (Kavanagh 2004) and may tolerate moderate levels of logging disturbance, provided old trees are retained within riparian zones and key sap tree species are retained (Goldingay and Kavanagh 1993; Kavanagh 2004), although such tolerance may be somewhat site-specific and vary with landscape context and subsequent management (Milledge <em>et al</em>. 1991; Eyre and Smith 1997; Lindenmayer <em>et al</em>. 1999). Extensive disturbance by logging or wildfire is detrimental (Lunney 1987)<em>.</em> Logging tends to reduce the proportion of large stems in a forest stand which reduces the availability of hollow-bearing trees (and den sites) and foraging substrate and food resources, including nectar, sap and invertebrates (Eyre and Smith 1997; Eyre 2002, 2004). Yellow-bellied Gliders are eliminated from clear-felled and intensively logged forests (Smith et al. 1994). Subpopulations of Yellow-bellied Gliders have declined or been extirpated from sites exposed to high intensity wildfire.<br/><br/>Females typically give birth to a single young annually (Goldingay 2008).</p>","Habitat loss and fragmentation due to timber-harvesting and agriculture are the main threats to this species. Due to past forest management there is a current dearth of available live hollow-bearing trees within Yellow-Bellied Glider habitats. Remaining hollow-bearing trees are therefore an important resource, but these are at risk of collapse due to regular prescribed burning regimes and windthrow. In Queensland and New South Wales (and possibly Victoria) broad-scale land clearing had been stopped due to newly introduced vegetation management legislation However, in Queensland relaxation of this legislation during the last three years has resulted in a sharp increase in forest clearing since 2013 (see <a href=""http://heconversation.com/land-clearing-in-queensland-triples-after-policy-ping-pong-38279"">https://theconversation.com/land-clearing-in-queensland-triples-after-policy-ping-pong-38279</a>). The effects of this recent change on Queensland populations of the Yellow-bellied Glider have not yet been specifically evaluated, but they are potentially significant. Furthermore, degradation to existing habitat (e.g., through fire, timber removal) within the habitat of isolated populations, but also between non-isolated populations, is a major threat to the species (essentially inducing a fragmentation effect) throughout its range, due to its wide-ranging and extensive habitat requirements (Woinarski <em>et al</em>. 2014).","There is no reliable estimate of population size.

It has a limited distribution and exists as a series of small, severely fragmented subpopulations. Significant declines in population size have occurred during the past decade in all forest types inhabited by the Leadbeater’s Possum. Of the available high quality habitat, 40-45% was burnt in the 2009 Black Saturday fires (D. Lindenmayer, D. Harley <em>pers. comm</em>. in Woinarski <em>et al</em>. 2014). Post-fire monitoring has shown that it is now absent from sites burnt in 2009, irrespective of burn severity, indicating that the population size has declined by &gt;40% since 2009. Monitoring of known subpopulations and modelling indicates that the current rate of decline is &gt;50% and suspected to be &gt;80% over the last 18 years (= three generations), with this rate likely to increase over the next 18 years. This species is therefore listed as Critically Endangered.</p>","<p>Leadbeater's Possum is a nocturnal, arboreal species that spends its day in tree hollows. Its diet mainly consists of exudates from trees and to a lesser extent arthropods (Smith 1984).<br/><br/>Optimum habitat for Leadbeater's Possum is a regenerating or uneven-aged Ash forest with a dense understorey of Acacia trees and an ample supply of old hollow trees. The species’ occurrence and population size is strongly linked to nest hollow availability (e.g. Lindenmayer <em>et al</em>. 1991, 2013).<br/><br/>Leadbeater’s Possums do not occur on burned sites until required conditions have returned (Lindenmayer <em>et al</em>.&#160;pers. comm., 2014a in Threatened Species Scientific Committee 2015).<br/><br/>The occurrence and quality of habitat is primarily determined by patterns of successional change and stand development resulting from disturbance, such as past wildfires and timber harvesting operations. Regrowth from the 1939 wildfires, combined with fire-killed remnants of mature forest, has provided abundant feeding and nesting habitat during the last 30 years.<br/><br/>Older aged and mixed aged forest containing live hollow-bearing trees also support populations of Leadbeater's Possum, although not in the same high densities that can be found in suitable regrowth forests. The role, however, of these suboptimal forests in the medium-term will be critical for conservation of the species. These forests are not subject to a rapid decline in habitat suitability that is predicted to occur in current high value habitat regrowth forests. Older aged forest and mixed aged forest with hollow-bearing trees and a low occurrence of wattles are defined as potentially optimum habitat because of their potential to become optimum in the short term (&lt;30 years), as a result of natural or deliberate disturbance. <br/><br/>In surveys to identify current strongholds after the 2009 fires, sites most likely to be occupied by Leadbeater’s Possum were generally characterised by lush, unburnt vegetation in gullies in areas that had relatively low summer temperatures and high summer rainfall (Lumsden <em>et al</em>. 2013).</p>","This species is heavily dependent on old trees, and fire-killed remnants that are rapidly decaying and falling over. Recruitment of suitable hollows, used for shelter and breeding, is very slow. The long-term viability of habitat in mature and mixed aged forests is threatened by wildfires and some timber harvesting practices. The species and its remnant habitat also are closely tied to a narrow set of climatic conditions that could be severely affected by global warming (Lindenmayer <em>et al.</em> 1991).","<p>During the past decade, and especially because of wildfire in 2009, severe declines have occurred in all forest types that the possum inhabits. <br/><br/>The discrete subpopulation in the small Yellingbo area was estimated to contain 60 individuals in 2012 (Threatened Species Scientific Committee 2015). The total population size across the main range of Leadbeater’s Possum is less well resolved. Threatened Species Scientific Committee (2015) noted a range of estimates from 2000 to 11,250, and concluded that the number of mature breeding individuals was less than 10,000 and very likely to be less than 2500.&#160;The 2009 Black Saturday fire burnt 45% of high quality Leadbeater’s Possum habitat (D. Harley pers. comm.&#160;in Woinarski <em>et al</em>. (2014)). Post-fire surveys indicate that the species is absent from burnt sites, regardless of burn severity (D. Lindenmayer pers. comm.&#160;in Woinarski <em>et al</em>. (2014); P. Menkhorst pers. comm.&#160;in Woinarski <em>et al.</em> (2014)). Thus, the population size is likely to have been reduced by at least 45% since 2009. The severe impacts of the 2009 fire are highlighted by results from Lake Mountain, where a major subpopulation stronghold containing 200-300 individuals was reduced to just six individuals (i.e. &gt;95% mortality) (D. Harley pers. comm.). The 2009 fires also reduced the availability of suitable tree hollows, particularly dead standing trees preferred by Leadbeater’s Possum.<br/><br/>Even prior to the 2009 fires, modelling predicted that subpopulations in montane ash forest would decline by about 90% over the 30 year period from 2008 due to loss of suitable den trees (Lindenmayer <em>et al</em>. 1990, 1997, 2012; Smith and Lindenmayer 1992; Menkhorst 2008).<br/><br/>Monitoring indicates that the Yellingbo subpopulation declined from 122 individuals in 2003 (D. Harley <em>pers. comm.&#160;</em>in Woinarski <em>et al</em>. (2014)) to just 60 individuals in 2012, representing a 46% decline over nine years (D. Harley pers. comm.<em>&#160;</em>in Woinarski <em>et al</em>. (2014)). There has been a 30% reduction in the occupied area of the reserve over this period, and it is estimated that less than 20 ha of high quality habitat is currently available (D. Harley pers. comm.&#160;in Woinarski <em>et al</em>. (2014)). Further declines are anticipated due to ongoing deterioration in habitat condition. Fire poses a major risk to this small, localized subpopulation.</p>",Decreasing,"Leadbeater’s Possum&#160;is endemic to Australia, where it is restricted to central Victoria. Most of its limited range is in the forests of the central highlands, bounded by Toolangi (in the west), Beenak (in the south), Mt Baw Baw (in the east) and Rubicon (in the north), in an elevational range from about 500 to 1,500 m a.s.l. (Harley 2004). An isolated subpopulation occurs at lower altitudes (<em>c</em>. 110 m a.s.l.) at Yellingbo, 16 km south-west of its main range (Harley <em>et al</em>. 2005; Hanson and Taylor 2008). Menkhorst (2008) considered its extent of occurrence was &lt;5,000 km<sup>2</sup>, and that ‘it has a limited distribution (&lt;3500 km<sup>2</sup>)’. The total ‘range’ occupied by the species was estimated as 3,526 km<sup>2</sup> by Department of Sustainability and Environment (2010). <br/><br/>Based on a small number of known historical records, its former range extended <em>c</em>. 120 km further to the north-east (Mt Wills), and more extensively to the south, from the Western Port region to the Yarra Valley, with this latter (lowland) subpopulation (now represented only at Yellingbo) evolutionarily distinct from the more extensive highland subpopulations (Harley 2004; Hansen and Taylor 2008). Bilney <em>et al</em>. (2010) reported bones of this species commonly in subfossil material (regurgitated pellets from Sooty Owls <em>Tyto tenebricosa</em>)&#160;in Gippsland, indicating it was more abundant and widespread prior to European settlement.<br/><br/>The extent of occurrence has changed little over the last three generations, but the number of occupied sites has declined dramatically following extensive wildfire in 2009.",,Terrestrial,"The Leadbeater's Possum occurs in a number of protected areas (including a 30,500 ha fragmented Leadbeater's Possum permanent reserve system)&#160;and is listed as a threatened species both nationally and within Victoria.

A Victorian government Action Statement, which described key management responses, was established and implemented in 2014 (Department of Environment and Primary Industries 2014). A national recovery plan is scheduled to be developed and implemented in 2016.&#160;Populations of this species have been monitored over the last several years conducted by numerous volunteers and public awareness of the plight of this species is high (Smith and Harley 2008). Research into the effects of fire and ways to improve timber harvesting techniques are important.<br/><br/>The species’ dependence on tree hollows that resulted from burnt remnant trees from the 1939 fires led to dire predictions about its population trend over the next 30 years as these trees continued to collapse, with similar concerns following the 2009 fires. The use of nest boxes as a management tool has received some attention as one way to possibly ameliorate the imminent cavity shortage. Research in the central highlands suggests that nest boxes receive a low rate of occupancy and would be ineffective as a large-scale solution to the problem (Lindenmayer <em>et al.</em> 2003). However, nest box occupancy rates are much higher at Yellingbo (Beyer and Goldingay 2006; Harley 2006).&#160;<br/><br/>Population viability analysis by Lumsden <em>et al</em>. (2013) found that the current reserve system alone to be insufficient to ensure the long-term conservation of the species, resulting in recommendations for additional management actions such as protection of known colonies in state forest, protection of additional areas of suitable habitat, habitat enhancements and alternative silvicultural practices (Lumsden <em>et al</em>. 2013; Threatened Species Scientific Committee 2015).&#160;<br/><br/>Large-scale clear-cutting and even-aged stand management is detrimental to the species, and there have been efforts to adopt harvest practices that are compatible with the conservation of the species. The preservation of more large trees with hollows and a dense habitat structure with an understorey of Acacias is essential (Smith and Lindenmayer 1992; Smith and Harley 2008). Recent management recommendations for timber harvesting&#160;have increasingly responded to some of&#160;the Leadbeater's Possum's needs. These include&#160;detailed recommendations for post fire timber salvage that protects patches of tall trees (Lindenmayer and Ough 2006), and maintenance of timber stands above threshold densities of large old trees.<br/><br/>The Threatened Species Scientific Committee (2015) concluded that the most effective way to prevent further decline and rebuild the population of Leadbeater’s Possum would be to cease timber harvesting within montane ash forests of the Central Highlands.",Australasian,,false,false,Global

The overall rate of decline in population size over the last 18-24 years (=three generations) was estimated at about 28% by the Threatened Species Scientific Committee (2012), with this rate substantially influenced by a severe decline in inland regions most exposed to recent drought. A separate expert elicitation process involving independent estimates (from 15 Koala experts) of population size in every bioregion inhabited by Koalas concluded that the Koala population size reduction or projected reduction over three generations is a mean of 29%, albeit with substantial variation amongst experts in estimation of this rate (McAlpine <em>et al</em>. 2012). Climate change is expected to lead to an increased rate of population reduction over the next 20-30 years, and the impacts of other threats will magnify over this period. Here we consider that the conservation status of the Koala is border-line between Near Threatened and Vulnerable, but we adopt a precautionary assessment given the proximity of the estimated current and projected rate of decline to the threshold, and published assessments of the likelihood of additional and compound impacts due to climate change (Woinarski <em>et al.</em> 2014)","<p>The Koala is an arboreal folivorous marsupial. It occurs in forests and woodlands, typically dominated by eucalyptus&#160;species. In inland (semi-arid) portions of its range, it occurs mainly in riparian woodlands (Ellis <em>et al</em>. 2002, Seabrook <em>et al</em>. 2011). Elsewhere distribution may be associated particularly with soil fertility (and hence foliage nutrient content) (Moore and Foley 2000). The Koala has a specialist diet, mostly limited to foliage of <em>Eucalyptus</em> species, with occasional intake of leaves of other plant (mostly <em>Myrtaceous</em>) genera (Martin and Handasyde 1999; Moore and Foley 2000, 2005). At high population densities, Koalas can defoliate preferred tree species, causing tree death and subsequent Koala population crash (Menkhorst 2004, 2008).<br/><br/>The Koala is mostly solitary, but individuals have extensive overlap in home ranges. Home range size varies substantially with forest structure and productivity, and males typically have larger home ranges than females. In a coastal forest in New South Wales, average home range size was 10 ha (for females) to 20 ha (for males) (Lassau <em>et al</em>. 2008); in inland Queensland home ranges were 100 ha (for females) to 135 ha (for males) (Ellis<em> et al</em>. 2002).<br/><br/>Breeding is seasonal, with births (typically of single young) in October-May. Females can produce young at annual intervals, but births per adult female per year average 0.3-0.8 (McLean 2003). Sexual maturity is reached at 18 months (Jackson 2007). In the wild, longevity of 12 (for males) to 15 years (for females) has been reported (Martin and Handasyde 1999). Generation length is 6-8 years (Phillips 2000).</p>","Current threats to this species include continued habitat destruction, fragmentation, and modification (which makes them vulnerable to predation by dogs, vehicle strikes, and other factors), bushfires, and disease, as well as drought associated mortality in habitat fragments. Public concern for the species is high. There are management problems with many populations; remnant populations living at high densities in isolated patches of habitat are at greatest risk (Martin <em>et al.</em> 2008). Effective management of some of the threats on the mainland could lead to excessive abundance and result in pest problems similar to those occurring on Kangaroo Island and in parts of Victoria.<br/><br/>The overall distribution of Koalas has been reduced since European settlement. This decline was primarily due to disease, bushfires, and widespread habitat destruction in the early decades of the 20<sup>th</sup> century. Commercial harvesting also took place across the range towards the end of the 19<sup>th</sup> century and early 20<sup>th</sup> century (large numbers, running into the millions, were killed for their pelts for a large export industry in Victoria, New South Wales, and Queensland). This was banned in Victoria in the 1890s, and it continued sporadically (and under regulation) in Queensland until 1927 (Hrdina and Gordon 2004). There is no evidence, however, that the early spate of commercial harvesting had any long-term impact on the overall population.&#160;Climate change is likely to have severe consequences for this species&#160;(Adams-Hosking <em>et al</em>. 2011a,b, 2012).","There are robust population estimates for some regions, notably the Mulga Lands of southwest Queensland (for which a 2009 estimate is about 12,000 individuals: Seabrook <em>et al</em>. 2011). More broadly, Queensland EPA (2006) estimated the Koala population size in Queensland in 2006 at between 100,000 and 300,000 individuals. In its 2012 listing advice, the Threatened Species Scientific Committee (2012) provided State-based ‘best estimates’ of population size in 2010, tallying to between 347,000 and 518,000 individuals across all States. Some other sources have concluded that the population size is &lt;100,000 individuals (see The Senate Environment and Communications References Committee 2011). A recent expert-based elicitation process provided an aggregated mean estimate of 330,000 individuals across the Koala’s current range (McAlpine <em>et al</em>. 2012), suggesting the number of mature individuals is <em>c</em>. 300,000.<br/><br/>Population densities are very variable between regions and across time: examples include 1-3 individuals/ha in coastal forests in south-eastern Queensland (Queensland EPA 2006), 0.01/ha in central Queensland (Melzer <em>et al</em>. 2000), 0.006/ha in coastal forests of south-eastern New South Wales (Jurskis and Potter 1997), and &gt;5/ha in forests on Kangaroo Island prior to population control (Masters <em>et al</em>. 2004).<br/><br/>Koala subpopulations may show marked fluctuation, with severe crashes associated with over-browsing (Menkhorst 2004, 2008) and with long periods of low rainfall or episodes of very high temperatures (Gordon <em>et al</em>. 1988, Seabrook <em>et al</em>. 2011).<br/><br/>Gordon <em>et al</em>. (2008) considered the overall direction for population trend for Koalas to be unknown. However, the evidence for overall reduction in population size over the past three generations is compelling, given sustained management to reduce or stabilize population density of the largest South Australian subpopulation, demonstration of major decline in parts of inland Queensland (notably in the Mulga Lands, where population size decreased over recent decades by 80%: Seabrook <em>et al</em>. 2011), and in much of the coastal range of south-eastern Queensland (e.g. 68% decline in the ‘Koala Coast’ region from 1999 to 2010) and New South Wales. However, trends in these regions are not necessarily typical of the broader range, and population trends may also vary between different subpopulations within regions: for example, while most monitored Queensland subpopulations have experienced decline over the last two decades, a low density population at Oakey on the eastern Darling Downs has shown relative stability in population size (McAlpine <em>et al</em>. 2012; G. Gordon pers. comm. 2014). Likewise, in New South Wales, subpopulations in coastal regions have declined (some, including around Eden and Iluka, to extirpation or nearly so), but there are several subpopulations (including Lismore, Campbelltown and Southern Highlands) that are relatively stable.<br/><br/>Regional-level population size and trend estimates were collated by the Threatened Species Scientific Committee (2012), based on information from sites with known population density information (or estimates of number of individuals in subpopulations) and monitoring results, extrapolated to regional scale, and summed over regions, with some sensitivity analysis. These estimates indicate a 20-year (1990-2010) decline in population size nationally of about 28%, with that decline greatest in low rainfall areas of western Queensland exposed to drought conditions. A summary of their interpretation of population status and trends is given in Table 1 in the Supplementary Material. The major uncertainties in these estimates of population trends arise from the wide range of estimates for the size of the Victorian subpopulations, and to the imprecision of extrapolations of limited site-specific data to broader regional trends.<br/>&#160;<br/>A separate and subsequent independent assessment of population size and trends was provided by McAlpine <em>et al</em>. (2012), based on an expert elicitation process (e.g. McBride <em>et al</em>. 2012) involving 15 experts in Koala ecology and management across the Koala’s range. Although some state-based population size estimates differed from those given by the Threatened Species Scientific Committee, this process reported a remarkably similar estimate of overall decline in population size of 28.6% in three generational periods (over a ‘sliding time window of the past three generations and the future three generations of koala (15-21 years)’), although with very wide bounds around the relevant population size and trend estimates (Table 2 in the Supplementary Material). These wide bounds are indicative of substantial disagreements between experts concerning population size and trends, and the sparse and not necessarily representative monitoring data for some subpopulations. Note also that McAlpine <em>et al</em>. (2012) used a 5-7 year period for generational length, in contrast to the 6-8 year period reported by Phillips (2000).<br/><br/>With respect to eligibility against IUCN criteria, it could be argued that the decline over the last three generations has been driven mainly by the impacts of a severe drought, that has now ceased, and hence that the relevant criterion is A1, for which a decline of &gt;50% in the relevant 20 year time frame would be required for eligibility. However, drought has been only one of many factors driving decline across the Koala’s range. Furthermore, the ability of inland Koala populations to recover from this recent drought is likely to be severely compromised by widespread tree death and the legacy impacts of vegetation clearance which will constrain options for repopulation of now fragmented habitat (Seabrook <em>et al</em>. 2011; Adams-Hosking <em>et al</em>. 2011a,b, 2012). Other threats will continue to cause broad-scale population decline across much of the Koala’s range, and the impacts of at least some of these threats may be expected to be exacerbated by climate change (Adams-Hosking <em>et al</em>. 2011a,b, 2012).",Decreasing,"The Koala was formerly common throughout the broad band of forests and woodlands dominated by <em>Eucalyptus</em> spp. extending from north Queensland to the south-eastern corner of mainland South Australia, Australia (Maxwell <em>et al.</em> 1996). Currently it occurs in northeastern, central, and southeastern Queensland with patchy populations in western areas; eastern New South Wales including the coastal strip and highlands of the Great Dividing Range, as well as the western plains and related riparian environments where suitable habitat occurs; Victoria; and southeastern South Australia. Its total geographic range has contracted significantly due to loss of large areas of habitat since European settlement. In Queensland, extent of occurrence and area of occupancy have contracted by about 30% (Gordon <em>et al.</em> 2006).<br/><br/>The Koala has been introduced to at least 12 islands including: Kangaroo (South Australia, 450,000 ha), French (Victoria, 17,470 ha), Phillip (Victoria, 10,116 ha), and Magnetic (Queensland, 5,200 ha) (Abbott and Burbidge 1995). It has also been introduced within the mainland in the Adelaide Region and along the Murray River (Maxwell <em>et al.</em> 1996).","Formerly Koala subpopulations were severely depleted by hunting (for furs), with millions killed. This hunting continued up to 1927 in Queensland (Hrdina and Gordon 2004, Gordon and Hrdina 2005, Gordon <em>et al</em>. 2008).",Terrestrial,"<p>There is no national recovery plan; however there is a national conservation and management strategy (NRMMC 2009), a recovery plan for the Koala in New South Wales (NSW DECC 2008), a management strategy in Victoria (Menkhorst 2004), and a conservation plan and management program for the Koala in Queensland (Queensland EPA 2006).<br/><br/>A recent parliamentary inquiry concluded that the national conservation and management strategy was largely ineffective (The Senate Environment and Communications References Committee 2011).<br/><br/>In part because of its iconic status, there has been a relatively long history of conservation management directed specifically at the Koala (e.g. Menkhorst 2004, 2008; Queensland EPA 2006; New South Wales Department of Environment and Climate Change 2008; Natural Resource Management Ministerial Council 2010). This has included a substantial history of translocations, including conservation marooning and re-introduction (mostly in Victoria, Menkhorst 2008) and introduction (mostly in South Australia: Masters <em>et al</em>. 2004), some land management and forestry prescriptions, monitoring, substantial research, and localized management of some threats.

It occurs in a range of forest types, including warm temperate rainforests, wet eucalypt forests and shrubby dry forests, particularly where there is a dense understorey, a mixed-species overstorey and moist friable soils (Seebeck <em>et al</em>. 1989; Nunan <em>et al</em>. 2000). It has been recorded from 100 to 1,400 m a.s.l. (Nunan <em>et al</em>. 2000; Department of Sustainability and Environment 2009). Long-footed Potoroos are probably territorial, with home range size varying from 14-60 hectares, larger in males than females (Green <em>et al</em>. 1998). Underground-fruiting fungi comprise the vast bulk of its diet, with some invertebrates and plant material also eaten (Green <em>et al</em>. 1999). Like other species of Potoroidae that feed on hypogeal fungi, the Long-footed Potoroos provides ecosystem services consisting of improving soil condition by digging through and turning over soil, and dispersing the spores of the ectomycorrhizal fungi on which it feeds, thereby benefitting plants by promoting mycorrhizal symbiosis. The abundance and diversity of fungi is affected by season and rainfall, fire regimes, logging and other disturbances (Claridge <em>et al</em>. 2000).<br/><br/>The Long-footed Potoroo is probably monogamous (Scotts and Seebeck 1989). Breeding may occur throughout the year, although births (of a single young) may peak in late winter and early spring (Green and Mitchell 1997).</p>","Major threats to the species include predation from foxes, dingoes, and feral dogs, which may lead to the low densities at which this species has been found (Menkhorst and Seebeck 2008). Introduced pigs might be competitors for this species' specialized food requirements. Inappropriate fire regimes might also affect the fungi on which this species depends. Logging activities appear to be detrimental to the species, but further research is required for confirmation (NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service 2002).","<p>There has been no robust estimate of the population size of this species, nor that of any of its subpopulations. Currently, population estimation is constrained by the difficulty of detecting the species, and the localized scale at which it is mostly being studied. It is generally accepted to be ‘rare’ (McKnight 2008). The total population size ‘seems unlikely to … exceed a few thousand individuals, and may be no more than a few hundred’ (Nunan <em>et al</em>. 2000; McKnight 2008).<br/><br/>Given the limited information on population size and historical distribution, the population trend is unknown (McKnight 2008), although is probably declining due to current fire regimes, predation and other factors. Although this information cannot be used to define population trends, an unprecedented number of roadkills has been reported recently in far eastern Gippsland in an area now subjected to intensive fox baiting under the recently established Southern Ark program, with 11 records in a 23 month period to November 2012, compared with fewer than five across the previous 20 years (A. Murray <em>pers. comm</em>. 2014).</p>",Decreasing,"<p>The Long-footed Potoroo is restricted to mainland south-eastern Australia, where it is currently known from three small disjunct areas. In near-coastal East Gippsland it has been recorded from more than 60 separate sites (‘sites include clusters of records’: Department of Sustainability and Environment 2009) within an area of <em>c</em>. 1600 km<sup>2</sup>. More recent (post 2008) records from road-kills and camera trapping, including at Cape Conran and west of the Snowy River, increase this known range (Department of Sustainability and Environment 2009; A. Murray <em>pers. comm</em>. 2014). An inland subpopulation in the Great Dividing Range of north-eastern Victoria (around the Barry Ranges and the headwaters of the Wonnangatta, Buffalo, Buckland and Ovens Rivers) is known from more than 60 sites within an area of more than 3000 km<sup>2</sup> (Department of Sustainability and Environment 2009). The third subpopulation occurs in far south-eastern New South Wales, including the South-East Forests National Park and Bondi, Nungatta and Yambulla State Forests, within an area of 200 km<sup>2</sup> (Nunan <em>et al</em>. 2000). Within these three broad locations (totalling 4,800 km<sup>2</sup>), Long-footed Potoroos are likely to occur in ‘only a relatively small proportion of the area’ (Department of Sustainability and Environment 2009).<br/><br/>Reflecting its recent discovery, the difficulty of detecting the species, and continuing targeted searching, the known range of the Long-footed Potoroo has increased over the last 20-30 years. However, this increase simply reflects more knowledge rather than range expansion, and the extent to which its actual range may have changed historically or in recent decades is unknown. Some limited fossil records, a 1900 specimen from near Rosedale (to the west of its current known range), and some clearing and intensive forestry activities in and around parts of its known range suggest that its actual range has probably declined slightly since European settlement.</p>",,Terrestrial,"<p>A Recovery Plan for this species was developed in 2000 (Nunan <em>et al</em>. 2000). An Action Statement, consistent with the Recovery Plan, was implemented in Victoria (Department of Sustainability and Environment 2009), and a Research Plan (Broome <em>et al</em>. 1997) and Recovery Plan (NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service 2002) was implemented in New South Wales.&#160;Most of the actions in these Plans have been implemented, mostly successfully . Surveys have substantially extended the known range. Broad-scale fox management, under the Southern Ark program, appears to have been instrumental in stabilizing if not increasing the population size in at least some areas (A. Murray <em>pers. comm</em>. in Woinarski <em>et al</em>. 2014).<br/><br/>Since its relatively recent discovery, the Long-footed Potoroo has been subject to specific protection measures, with exclusion of forestry activities and intensive baiting of introduced predators (targeting foxes) around known localities in Victoria. In New South Wales, much of the known range of the species now occurs within the boundaries of conservation reserves, so ongoing forestry activities are not an issue. Ongoing 1080 baiting of introduced predators is also a high priority management action in that State. Across the Australia-wide distribution of the species there has been significant survey effort as well as some ecological research.<br/><br/>&#160;A captive population was maintained for several years at Healesville Sanctuary in Victoria, but was not viable in the long-term due to lack of replenishment over time and poor breeding success (Department of Sustainability and Environment 2009).</p>",Australasian,,false,false,Global

However, an overall decline in population size is inferred and projected, at a rate approaching but not &gt;30% over 9-12 years (=three generations). The causes of this are increasing intensity of destructive wildfires within the species range, effects of habitat fragmentation, and continuing impacts of invasive predators, especially the Red Fox. The Long-nosed Potoroo is therefore listed as Near Threatened as it almost qualifies for a threatened listing under criterion A2ce.<br/><br/>Population size cannot be estimated reliably. Population trends vary across the range, with general pattern of decline (particularly for the northern subspecies) but some local increases evident in areas subjected to effective control of the Red Fox.","<p>The Long-nosed Potoroo occurs in a range of vegetation types characterized by dense understoreys, including shrublands, coastal scrub, heathlands, forest and woodlands, and rainforests (Seebeck <em>et al</em>. 1989; Johnston 2008; Norton <em>et al</em>. 2010). It is often most likely to occur near creeks or gullies. Optimal habitat often includes a mosaic of different vegetation types, with denser vegetation used for shelter and more open areas for foraging (Seebeck 1981; Bennett 1993; Norton <em>et al</em>. 2010). Hypogeal (underground-fruiting) fungi comprise most of the diet (Claridge <em>et al</em>. 1993). The species provides significant ecosystem services through its foraging for hypogea fungi, in two ways. First, digging for fungi produces substantial turnover of soil, which improves soil condition and water infiltration (Fleming <em>et al.</em> 2014). Second, the Long-nosed Potoroo disperses spores of these fungi in its faeces. Because these fungi are mycorrhizal, feeding by the Potoroo promotes formation of mycorrhiza and benefits many plant species (Claridge <em>et al. </em>1992). The diet also includes some invertebrates, fruits, seeds, leaves, roots, and flowers (Bennett and Baxter 1989).<br/><br/>Long-nosed Potoroos are mostly solitary. Home range size is 1-19 ha, with home ranges larger in males than females (Kitchener 1973; Long 2001). The species shows limited dispersal ability (A. Murray <em>pers. comm</em>. 2014). Reproduction occurs year-round, with a single young produced at a time (Guiler 1960; Bryant 1989; Norton <em>et al</em>. 2011; Frankham <em>et al</em>. 2011). Females typically produce 2-3 young per year (Bennett 1987; Seebeck <em>et al</em>. 1989). Sexual maturity is reached at one year (Bennett 1987; Bryant 1989), and longevity can be at least seven years (Guiler and Kitchener 1967) but is more generally four to five years (Martin and Temple-Smith 2012). Generation length is around three years.</p>","The major threat is predation, especially by the invasive Red Fox (Brown and Triggs 1990; Lunney <em>et al</em>. 1990, 2002; Short 1998; Martin and Temple-Smith 2012), but also by wild dogs and feral cats. Habitat quality is affected by clearing and fragmentation, fires that are too frequent or too intense, livestock, and timber harvesting&#160;(Bennett 1993;&#160;Norton <em>et al</em>. 2011;&#160;Martin and Temple-Smith 2012).","On the mainland, the Long-nosed Potoroo is rare, and populations are extremely fragmented; the species may undergo fluctuations in numbers. It is also rare on the Bass Straits islands but is more common in Tasmania (Johnston 2008). Subfossil remains suggest that the species was formerly more widespread. The reasons for decline are unclear, however, habitat loss through clearance of native vegetation is likely to have at least partly caused a decline in populations (Johnston 2008). The species is susceptible to effects of forest fragmentation, being rarely found in forest patches smaller than approximately 30 ha (Bennett 1990).<br/><br/>There has been no robust estimate of the population size of this species, nor that of most subpopulations. However, this species usually occurs in small populations with low recruitment and low turnover of individuals (Bennett 1987).

It has been successfully introduced (assisted colonisation) to Bald Island Nature Reserve (8 km<sup>2</sup>) and is being reintroduced to a 3.8 km<sup>2</sup> mainland island at Waychinicup National Park. The main factors that are the cause of the species being eligible for listing in the Critically Endangered category are its small population size and its precarious geographic distribution.&#160;In 2012 there was estimated to be 100 individuals (Woinarski <em>et al</em>. 2014) but it has approximately halved in 2015, mostly due to fires.","<p>Gilbert’s Potoroos inhabit dense, long-unburnt heathland. At Two Peoples Bay, the heaths they inhabit are about 1.5-2.5 m high and are dominated by <em>Melaleuca striata</em> and <em>M. thymoides</em> with a dense layer of sedges underneath. The area has not been burnt for more than 50 years (Courtenay and Friend 2004). In the past, local colonies were probably wiped out by fire, as the general area is fire prone, but would have moved back into regenerating vegetation from nearby colonies (Friend 2009).</p>    <p>The diet consists almost entirely of fungi. A study of dietary composition based on faecal analysis (Nguyen <em>et al</em>. 2004) found that fungal material made up more than 90% of the scat contents, the remainder comprising sand and root material that had apparently been ingested incidentally, as well as invertebrates and occasionally seeds from fleshy fruits. While 44 species of fungi were consumed in total, five species were found to be consumed by over 60% of animals in all seasons of the year. Gilbert’s Potoroo is one of the most fungi dependent mammals in the world.</p>  <br/>Trapping and radio-tracking has shown that Gilbert’s Potoroos live in small groups in the patchy habitat. These colonies are isolated from each other but dispersing sub-adult animals and some older males move between them. Amongst resident animals there is little overlap in home range between animals of the same sex, but there is strong overlap between males and females (Courtenay and Friend 2004).","Predation by introduced red foxes and feral cats are the major threats. Fire is also a major threat at Two Peoples Bay as the subpopulation there is highly restricted and dependent on old vegetation. A large fire would eliminate most habitat and exacerbate predation by feral cats and red foxes. Bald Island is thought not to have burnt for hundreds of years.&#160;<br/>In November 2015 a bushfire burnt through the Mt Gardner headland of Two Peoples Bay Nature Reserve, near Albany, Western Australia and severely impacted the habitat of the original wild population of Gilbert’s Potoroo. In January 2016 this species was identified as one of the 20 mammals within the Australian Government’s Threatened Species Strategy for priority conservation. This conservation advice has been updated in consultation with the Western Australia government to reflect the current status of this species and any proposed changes to conservation actions (Woinarski <em>et al</em>. 2014).","Gilbert’s Potoroo was rediscovered on Mount Gardner within Two Peoples Bay Nature Reserve in 1994 after the implementation of a fox baiting program. Currently, there are an estimated 30-40 individuals in the Mount Gardner subpopulation and this appears to be the maximum that can be supported by the available habitat (Friend 2008b, 2009). Ten Gilbert’s Potoroos were translocated from the wild population on Mount Gardner to Bald Island in six separate releases between 2005–2007 (Friend 2009, Finlayson <em>et al</em>. 2010). Recent estimates suggest a current (2012) population on Bald Island of around 60 (T. Friend <em>pers</em>.<em> comm</em>.). In 2009, six Bald Island animals were removed in the first of a series of transfers, along with captive animals, to start a new semi-captive population in a 380 ha fenced area in Waychinicup National Park, in 2012 comprising more than 20 animals. In late 2007 (five years prior to this evaluation) there were c. 40-45 mature individuals, and the number may have exceeded 50 mature individuals of Gilbert’s Potoroo by the end of 2009 (T. Friend <em>pers</em>.<em> comm</em>.). However, recent data (2014) suggest that the species has declined at some sites.",Decreasing,"Gilbert’s Potoroos probably never had a large geographic range, as subfossil and modern data reveal a past distribution near the south coast of Western Australia from near Margaret River to near Albany. Three early collectors found it in the vicinity of King George Sound (Albany) between 1840 and 1879, but exact locations are unknown. John Gilbert, who collected specimens for John Gould, reported that he had not heard of it being found anywhere else but King George Sound (Gould 1863). Gilbert’s Potoroo was, for a long time, thought to be extinct, despite targeted searches (Kabay and Start 1976), until it was rediscovered on Mount Gardner, Two Peoples Bay Nature Reserve, in 1994 (Sinclair <em>et al</em>. 1996).

Cross fostering was carried out over on an experimental basis with limited success (Taggart <em>et al</em>. 2010). Considerable research has been conducted into the biology, ecology and reproduction of Gilbert’s Potoroo and is ongoing. Extensive searches using hair-trapping have been carried out in suitable habitat along the coast from Two Peoples Bay to Northcliffe and in the Margaret River area. Less targeted surveys have been carried out to the east of Albany, especially in the Fitzgerald River National Park, but no new populations have been discovered. The majority of ongoing funding has been provided by the Western Australian Department of Environment and Conservation and the Australian Government through the Natural Heritage Trust, with contributions from the Gilbert’s Potoroo Action Group, WWF-Australia Threatened Species Network, and the Foundation for Australia’s Most Endangered Species Ltd (FAME).<br/>  <p>Following rediscovery of Gilbert’s Potoroo, there was extensive research into the species’ biology and ecology (e.g. Sinclair <em>et al</em>. 1996, 2000, 2002; Sinclair and Westerman 1997; Nguyen <em>et al</em>. 2004; Cochrane <em>et al</em>. 2005; Vaughan <em>et al</em>. 2007; Austin <em>et al</em>. 2009; Friend 2009; Bougher and Friend 2009; Lee <em>et al</em>. 2009; Taggart <em>et al</em>. 2010; Stead-Richardson <em>et al</em>. 2010) and a captive breeding facility was constructed in the hope that captive-bred potoroos could be reintroduced to other conservation reserves. Captive breeding, however, has proved to be difficult (Friend 2009), even with cross-fostering (Taggart <em>et al</em>. 2010), and the decision was taken to introduce wild potoroos from Two Peoples Bay to Bald Island Nature Reserve, the only island in the region that had suitable habitat.

21960911,2783,Bettongia gaimardi,Near Threatened,,2016,2016-02-11 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p>The Eastern Bettong is currently quite widespread and locally abundant in Tasmania, but with a fragmented distribution. It does not meet the criteria for a classification of Vulnerable, but its extent of occurrence is close to the threshold at which it would be considered Vulnerable under criterion B1 if there was also evidence for continuing decline in occurrence, occupancy, habitat quality or abundance. It is therefore possible that increases in predation or declines in habitat quality in the near future could move the species into the Vulnerable category. These changes are possible, given that (i) the feral Cat is widespread in the habitat of the Eastern Bettong, and studies on a closely related species, the Woylie (Marlow <em>et al. </em>2015) show that increases in the cat population could have major impacts, and (ii) intensification of agriculture in parts of eastern Tasmania could result in increased fragmentation and declines in quality of habitat. Similarly, if the Red Fox were to become established in Tasmania this could be expected to have a major impact on the Eastern Bettong, given the evidence that Red Fox predation caused the extinction of the Eastern Bettong from mainland Australia (Short 1998; Johnson 2006).&#160;</p>","<p>Mainland animals apparently inhabited open forest with a grassy understorey (Seebeck 1995). In Tasmania, the species occurs in eucalypt and casuarina forests and woodlands with grassy or heath ground cover. During the daytime the animals take refuge in nests built under a fallen limb or among short bushes or tussocks, and sited in a shallow depression dug by the animal. The nests are spherical structures with a side entrance. They are well camouflaged and constructed using nesting material collected by the animal, and transported in bundles held in the prehensile tail. The outer wall of the nest is built with coarse grass and twigs, and the resting chamber is given an inner lining of softer grasses or fibres stripped from the bark of stringybark trees. The diet is mainly hypogeal fungi but also includes seeds, tubers and bulbs (Johnson 1994). Home range is 65-135 ha and an individual can travel up to 1.5 km between its nest and feeding areas (Rose and Rose 1998; Rose and Johnson 2008).<br/><br/>The eastern bettong provides important ecosystem services. Like other bettongs, and potoroos, it digs for its food, creating many small foraging pits (Fleming et al 2014). These create microtopographic variation that promotes regeneration of some plants, and digging contributes to loosening and turnover of soil, which improves soil condition and water infiltration and promotes the breakdown of organic matter. Most of the fungi eaten by the Eastern Bettong are mycorrhiza-forming species. As a result of feeding on their fruiting bodies, the Eastern Bettong disperses the spores of these fungi in its faeces. This is probably a crucial factor in the maintenance of ectomycorrhizal symbiosis in the dry forests inhabited by the Eastern Bettong. This in turn helps maintain the productivity and diversity of plant communities (Johnson 1996).<br/><br/>The Eastern Bettong breeds throughout the year. Individuals reach sexual maturity within their first year, and females can produce up to three young per year.</p>","The Eastern Bettong is potentially threatened by predation from the Red Fox&#160;(<em>Vulpes vulpes</em>) and feral Cat (<em>Felis catus</em>). Historically, the Red Fox has not occurred in Tasmania, but if it&#160;were to become established in Tasmania this could be expected to have a major impact on the Eastern Bettong, given the evidence that predation by the Red Fox caused the species' extinction from mainland Australia (Short 1998; Johnson 2006). There is evidence of a recent incursion of the Red Fox, possibly as a result of a deliberate introduction (Sarre <em>et al.</em> 2013). This triggered an eradication program (<a href=""http://dpipwe.tas.gov.au/invasive-species/current-programs/fox-eradication-program"">http://dpipwe.tas.gov.au/invasive-species/current-programs/fox-eradication-program</a>). There have been no definite records of foxes in Tasmania since 2011 (<a href=""http://dpipwe.tas.gov.au/invasive-species/current-programs/fox-eradication-program/fox-evidence-update"">http://dpipwe.tas.gov.au/invasive-species/current-programs/fox-eradication-program/fox-evidence-update</a>). Analysis of the pattern of fox records through time suggests the population may now be extinct (Caley <em>et al</em>. 2015). The Red Fox remains a potential threat to the Tasmanian Bettong.<br/><br/>Eastern Bettongs are threatened by predation by feral domestic Cats (Fancourt 2014). There is some evidence that the abundance or activity of feral Cats has increased in Tasmania following the decline of the Tasmanian Devil (<em>Sarcophilus harrisii</em>) (Hollings<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2013), but the magnitude of this change is still unclear. Recent surveys show that Eastern Bettongs remain abundant in areas where feral cats are present, provided that habitat patches are sufficiently large (R. Gardiner <em>pers. comm. </em>2015). A very similar species, the Woylie or Brush-tailed Bettong <em>Bettongia penicillata</em>, has recently suffered major declines in south western Western Australia as a result of predation by feral Cats (Marlow <em>et al.</em> 2015). In that case, predation by feral Cats increased following suppression of Red Fox populations by poison baiting, which probably allowed population growth in feral Cats. If the abundance or activity of feral Cats were to increase in a similar way in Tasmania, it is possible that mortality of Eastern Bettongs would increase substantially and populations could decline. It is also possible that feral Cats threaten Eastern Bettongs by transmitting the disease toxoplasmosis, but the evidence from Western Australia suggests that direct predation is likely to be more significant (Marlow <em>et al. </em>2015).<br/><br/>The sensitivity of the Eastern Bettong to fragmentation of its dry forest and woodland habitat also suggests that further loss of habitat extent could lead to localized extinctions. Possibly, threats from fragmentation (and associated loss of habitat quality) and predation could interact, such that exposure of Eastern Bettongs to feral Cats is higher where habitat has been reduced or degraded, and cats also increase in abundance as a result of disturbances associated with habitat fragmentation. This suggests that even quite small changes in habitat or Cat abundance could be amplified to produce significant population declines.","<p>In Tasmania, this species is moderately common in suitable habitat but has been affected by past clearing of dry sclerophyll forest and woodland, especially in the midlands of Tasmania. Little of its habitat is protected within reserves and the highest densities occur on private land (DPIPWE 2012). It is sensitive to fragmentation of its habitat. Mammal spotlighting surveys carried out by the Department of Primary Industries, Parks, Water and Environment across Tasmania only detect low numbers of bettongs which have fluctuated widely over the past decade. Recent surveys using camera trapping show that in the midlands bettongs occur only in forest patches larger than approximately 50 ha (R. Gardiner <em>pers. comm.</em> 2015). Abundance has been observed to fluctuate widely within areas of stable habitat, for reasons that are not understood (K. Proft <em>pers. comm.</em> 2015). On the other hand, Tasmanian bettongs sometimes occur at high abundance in plantation forests (M. Pauza <em>pers. comm.</em> 2012). One documented case shows a local population decline in response to increased activity of feral cats (Fancourt 2014), but more extensive surveys have not provided evidence for a general recent impact of cats on abundance (R. Gardiner and R. Hamer <em>pers. comm.</em> 2015).&#160;</p>",Unknown,"The Eastern Bettong formerly occurred throughout much of mainland south-eastern Australia from south-eastern Queensland to south-eastern South Australia, but is now extinct on mainland Australia. It remains widespread in eastern Tasmania from sea level up to 1000 m, however its distribution there is fragmented by land clearing, especially in the midlands of Tasmania. It occurs naturally on Bruny Island (367 km<sup>2</sup>; Driessen <em>et al</em>. 2010) and was introduced to Maria Island (104 km<sup>2</sup>) in 1971. Rounsevell <em>et al</em>. (1991) recorded it in 33% of 10 km x 10 km grids in Tasmania, all in the eastern half of the State. In 2011 some Tasmanian Bettongs were brought from Tasmania to establish a captive-breeding colony in Tidbinbilla Nature Reserve, Australian Capital Territory. In May 2012, animals were translocated from this colony to Mulligans Flat Woodland Sanctuary, ACT, a fenced mainland island of c. 400 ha of Yellow Box <em>Eucalyptus melliodora</em> – Blakely’s Red Gum <em>E. blakelyi</em> grassy woodland. This enclosed population has flourished, and it is hoped that it will be possible to use it as a source of animals to be released into nearby unfenced areas subject to control of introduced predators (A. Manning <em>pers. comm. </em>2015).",,Terrestrial,"This species is listed on Appendix I of CITES. It is present in some protected areas.

21961179,2784,Bettongia lesueur,Near Threatened,,2019,2012-12-31 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p>The Boodie is listed as Near Threatened because it is conservation dependent. The conservation programs that focus on the species are the continued exclusion of invasive predators from large fenced reserves on the mainland of Australia. These reserves are at Heirisson Prong, Yookamurra, Scotia and Roxby Downs. Subpopulations in these reserves have survived and reproduced for &gt;5 years. The success of other assisted colonisations is pending. Protection of these subpopulations consists of local eradication of predators, fencing to maintain exclusion, and continued monitoring and maintenance of fences. Lapses in such management could quickly result in subpopulation extinction.&#160;</p><p>If all such dependent populations were to be lost, the species would survive on only five offshore islands, and be assessed as Vu (D2). The island populations consist of three that survived the original decline of the species (Barrow, 235 km²; Bernier, 43 km²; and Dorre, 52 km²) as well as two where the species has been established by translocation (Boodie Island, 1.7 km²; and Faure Island 52 km²). These populations are monitored regularly, but not subjected to intensive management.&#160;&#160;</p>","<p>Boodies are thought to be the only Australian macropod to shelter in underground warrens, although it is possible that the extinct Nullarbor Dwarf Bettong <em>B. pusilla</em> also used warrens. Warrens on Bernier and Dorre Islands and on Heirisson Prong typically have two or three entrances in sandy soils, but on rocky Barrow Island, warrens may have up to 120 entrances (Short and Turner 1993). Warrens constructed by Boodies are still obvious in a variety of rocky and stony landscapes in central Australia and on the Nullarbor Plain (Burbidge <em>et al</em>. 2007); rabbits now occupy some of these. Before the decline of Boodies, Brushtail Possums <em>Trichosurus vulpecula</em> and Chuditch <em>Dasyurus geoffroii</em> and other animals also occupied their warrens.<br/><br/>Boodies are nocturnal and gregarious. They emerge from warrens after sunset and return before sunrise. Food is procured largely by digging and appears to be located by smell. They are omnivorous, eating underground fungi, fruit, seeds, tubers, roots, bulbs and arthropods, particularly termites. At Heirisson Prong the diet comprises hypogeal fungi, fruit, seed, forbs, and arthropods in winter, and browse from shrubs such as <em>Acacia ligulata</em>, <em>Senna chatelainiana</em>, <em>Eremophila</em> spp., <em>Pimelea microcephala</em>, and <em>Olearia </em>spp., fruit, seed, stem, and some forbs in summer (Robley <em>et al.</em> 2001). The average home range sizes for males and females at Heirisson Prong were 107 and 86 ha respectively (Robley 1999), and on Barrow Island were 133 and 98 ha (Short and Turner 1990) for males and females respectively.</p>","The current major threats to the natural populations of the species include: the accidental introduction of predators (introduced cats and foxes), fire, and disease (Richards 2005). Introduced rats and mice are also a concern, but to a lesser degree than introduced predators. These same threats apply to varying degrees to the reintroduced populations. Extreme fluctuations in populations on islands are a threat, but this threat is seen as minor relative to the risk exotic predators being introduced (Short <em>et al.</em> 1997). It is also unclear to what extent population fluctuations occur at the reintroduction sites on the mainland. This species would likely qualify as having ""extreme fluctuations"" in population in terms of the IUCN criteria (IUCN 2001) if it were still restricted to the islands off of Western Australia. This is because these fluctuations are tied to climatic extremes that are likely to be synchronous in these locations, but unlikely to be in synchrony with fluctuations (should they occur) in reintroduced populations in South Australia and New South Wales.<br/><br/>Presumably, overgrazing of suitable habitat by cattle and rabbits, loss of wooded areas to agriculture, as well as changes to the fire regime contributed to the decline of the species on mainland Australia. Introduced species, particularly feral cats and foxes, are thought also to have led to its mainland demise (Richards 2005). Feral cats are a proven threat to this species, as they predated on all animals in a trial reintroduction in the Gibson Desert, Western Australia (A. Burbidge pers. comm.). It is believed to have been extirpated from Dirk Hartog Island by foxes and/or feral cats (Burbidge and Short 2008). The role of disease is unclear, but may have been a historical threat.<br/><br/>Black Rats were a historical threat to the species on Boodie Island. It suffered greater losses, however, due to a rat-baiting program that accidentally eradicated the species from island in 1985. In 1993 the species was reintroduced to Boodie Island from Barrow Island (Morris 2002).","Boodies were once very abundant under good seasonal conditions on the mainland. Recent estimates of numbers on islands and mainland islands are Barrow Island 3400 (1988; Short and Turner 1993), Boodie Island 200 (2011; K. D. Morris <em>pers. comm</em>.), Bernier Island 842 (2010), Dorre Island 3291 (2010), Faure Island 3000-4000 (2012; Sarah Legge <em>pers. comm</em>.), Heirisson Prong 400-500 (2012; Jeff Short, <em>pers. comm</em>.), Arid Recovery Project 2260 (2010), Scotia 1300 (2012) and Yookamurra 260 (2012) (Sarah Legge <em>pers. comm</em>).

It became restricted to three islands off the Western Australian coast: Barrow, Bernier and Dorre. </p>    <p>The Boodie was reintroduced to Boodie Island in 1993 and was introduced to Faure Island in 2002.

In the western deserts, Aboriginal people reported that they occupied sand plains and dunes with spinifex (<em>Triodia</em> spp.) hummock grassland. The remnant subpopulations in south-western Australia inhabit woodlands and adjacent heaths with a dense understorey of shrubs, particularly <em>Gastrolobium</em> spp., which contain monofluoroacetic acid, the compound present as sodium monofluoroacetate in the vertebrate pesticide ‘1080’. Diet is largely underground fungi, although it includes tubers, bulbs and seeds. Woylies can store seed in their cheek pouches for later caching and are a major distributor of fungal spores and seeds (Murphy <em>et al</em>. 2005). Their digging also has a positive impact on the non-wetting property of soils (Garkaklis<em> et al</em>. 1998). </p>    <p>They are solitary animals but nest sharing (usually mother and young at heel) has been recorded (Sampson 1971, Christensen and Leftwich 1980, Start <em>et al</em>. 1995). They occupy home ranges, the size of which varies between habitats, sites and according to Woylie density. Small home ranges (less than 6&#160;ha) are generally observed at high density occurrences (Nelson 1989 in Nelson <em>et al</em>. 1992; Hide 2006). Males tend to have larger home ranges than females (Sampson 1971, Leftwich 1983), although this is not always so when Woylies are at higher densities (Yeatman 2010).</p>","The major reason for past decline has been predation by Red Foxes and feral cats, exacerbated in the deserts by changed fire regimes. The recent crash in numbers is thought to be primarily due to feral cats, although exotic disease may be involved. Inappropriate fire regimes may exacerbate fox and cat predation.","<p>Accounts by early settlers (e.g. Facey 1981) and Aboriginal people (e.g. Burbidge <em>et al</em>. 1988) demonstrate that Woylies were once abundant. In arid Australia Woylies declined after European settlement and survived the establishment of the feral Cat, but disappeared soon after the establishment of the Red Fox (Burbidge <em>et al</em>. 1988). Abundance in the four remnant Western Australian wheatbelt subpopulations has varied, with Sampson (1971) at Tutanning and Christensen (1980) at Perup finding numbers to be relatively high during the 1960s and 1970s. However, numbers fluctuated, e.g. Kinnear <em>et al</em>. (2002) found Woylies to be rare at Tutanning in 1984. Trap success rates at Tutanning increased from c. 2% in 1984 to c. 28% in 1992 following the implementation of fox control (Wayne <em>et al</em>. 2010). Following the introduction of widespread fox control under ‘Western Shield’ in 1996, Woylie numbers rapidly increased at all four of the original locations and translocations were conducted to several sites in the northern jarrah forest and wheatbelt in Western Australia, a total of 46 translocations in all, and to sites in eastern Australia (Wayne <em>et al</em>. 2008). </p>    <p>From about 2000, there was a significant decline in all free-ranging Woylie populations, natural and reintroduced (Groom 2010). At a species level Woylies were found to have declined by c. 90% from a peak of c. 250&#160;000 individuals in 1999 to 33&#160;000 in 2010. The largest subpopulation, at Upper Warren, declined by 95% from an estimated peak of 215&#160;000 in 1999 (Wayne <em>et al</em>. 2011). A major research program coordinated by the Western Australian Department of Parks and Wildlife investigated the reasons for the decline including predation (Wayne <em>et al</em>. 2011; 2013; N. Marlow and P. de Tores <em>pers. comm</em>.) and disease (e.g. Botero <em>et al</em>. 2013), with several further papers yet to be published.</p>    <p>Forty-one Woylies were translocated to the Perup Sanctuary mainland island in October-December 2010. In November 2012, 161 independent Woylie individuals were captured but due to trap saturation (80 traps x 4 nights) an accurate estimate could not be achieved. The number is probably around 200 (A. Wayne pers. comm.).</p>",Decreasing,"<p>Formerly very widespread, Woylies occupied most of semi-arid and arid Australia, mostly south of the tropics, including the arid and semi-arid zones of Western Australia, the Northern Territory, South Australia, New South Wales and Victoria, and possibly extended north along the east coast into Queensland, the remnant of this population now being accepted as <em>Bettongia tropica</em>. Woylies also occurred on Saint Francis and St Peter Islands, South Australia (Robinson <em>et al</em>. 1996). Burbidge <em>et al</em>. (2009), using modern, historical and subfossil records, found that Woylies (excluding <em>B. tropica</em>) are known to have occurred in 28 of Australia’s 85 bioregions and that they are now extinct in all but two.</p>    <p>By 1970, they remained only in four subpopulations in south-western Australia: Dryandra, Tutanning, Kingston and Perup. Pacioni <em>et al</em>. (2011) used a molecular approach (12 microsatellite loci and mitochondrial DNA) to investigate relationships between these subpopulations. </p>    <p>In 1975, the South Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service began a breeding program for the species at Para Wirra Recreation Park from animals sourced from Perth Zoo with the goal of providing stock to re-establish the species in South Australia. The first experimental releases were onto two small islands, Bird Club Island (8 ha) in 1979 and Venus Bay ‘Island A’ (15 ha) in 1980, followed by three larger islands, St Francis Island (809ha) in 1980, St Peter Island (3493 ha) in 1981 and Wedge Island (947 ha) in 1983 (Delroy <em>et al</em>. 1986, Freegard 2008, Yeatman and Groom 2012). Woylies did not survive on Bird Club Island, probably due to foxes accessing the island. Neither did they survive on St Francis Island (reasons unknown) (Robinson <em>et al</em>. 1996). These translocated Woylie subpopulations are genetically depauperate (Pacioni 2010), having been derived mostly from the small Para Wirra founder group.</p>    <p>There have been numerous reintroductions to parts of the south-west of Western Australia and some to New South Wales, but some have failed in the medium- to long-term (Priddell and Wheeler 2004, Wayne <em>et al</em>. 2011; Yeatman and Groom 2012). Remaining unfenced subpopulations from these reintroductions in Western Australia are Julimar Forest (1995-2011), Avon Valley National Park (2002-2004), Boyagin Nature Reserve (1992), several sites in the northern and central jarrah forest (the current status of some of these is unknown), Batalling Forest (1982), and North Karlgarin Nature Reserve (2005).<br/></p>    Recently, ‘insurance’ subpopulations in fenced mainland islands have been established at Whiteman Park Recreation and Conservation Reserve (near Perth) and Perup Sanctuary (a 420 ha fenced area, east of Manjimup) (Yeatman and Groom 2012).

Woylies were removed from the Commonwealth and Western Australian threatened species lists in 1996 following an assessment of status (Start <em>et al</em>. 1998). However, from about 2000, Woylies have suffered a significant ongoing decline and they became again the subject of conservation research and management. Woylie conservation was then guided by an interim recovery plan (Freegard 2008). A revised national recovery plan was finalised in 2012 (Yeatman and Groom 2012).

Remaining fragmented subpopulations in coastal habitats are also declining rapidly, equating to a population decline of &gt;80% in the past 10 years. With rainfall in the south-west of Western Australia predicted to decline further and continuing urban coastal development, there is a projected continuing decline of &gt;80% within the next 10 years.</p>","The Western Ringtail Possum is an arboreal marsupial with a maximum body weight of 1,330 g for both sexes (Wayne <em>et al</em>. 2005a). It formerly occurred in a variety of vegetation types including coastal Peppermint (<em>Agonis flexuosa</em>) forests and woodlands and Peppermint / Tuart (<em>Eucalyptus gomphocephala</em>) associations, eucalypt associations of Jarrah (<em>E. marginata</em>) / Marri (<em>Corymbia calophylla</em>) / Wandoo (<em>E. wandoo</em>) (Christensen <em>et al</em>. 1985), Wandoo / Casuarina (<em>Allocasuarina huegeliana</em>) woodland in the wheatbelt, and presumably eucalypt woodland, mallee and mallee heath from the Hampton Tableland (Baynes 1987) and other areas. It is now almost exclusively restricted to coastal and near coastal Peppermint woodland between the Australind - Eaton area and Waychinicup National Park (Burbidge and de Tores 1998). The Upper Warren area had the only known sites where Western Ringtail Possums recently persisted in significant numbers in the absence of Peppermint.<br/><br/>In coastal Peppermint habitat, Western Ringtail Possums build dreys as nesting/resting sites and uses tree hollows where available (e.g., Tuart and Marri). Where protection from introduced predators is provided, a wide range of nest sites on or near the ground has been recorded, including low shrub thickets (e.g., Basket Bush (<em>Spyridium globulosum</em>), Orange Wattle (<em>Acacia saligna</em>), Summer-scented Wattle (<em>A. rostellifera</em>)), sedges and rushes (ringtails have been commonly recorded nesting on the ground under sword sedge (<em>Lepidosperma gladiatum</em>) (How <em>et al</em>. 1984, Jones <em>et al</em>. 1994a). In the absence of predator control and in the absence of Peppermint or other nesting/drey material, or where fire is frequent, tree hollows and hollow logs are used almost exclusively, although urban animals will use roof spaces and other shelter. At translocation sites in the Jarrah forest near Dwellingup, where foxes are controlled, 20% of over 400 recorded day rest locations were at or below 1.5 m in height. These sites included hollow logs on the ground, fallen branches and debris on the ground, coppicing jarrah stumps, in and under Grass Tree (<em>Xanthorrhoea</em> sp.) leaf ‘skirts’ and in Water Bush (<em>Bossiaea</em> sp.) and Karri Hazel (<em>Trymalium</em> sp.) In Jarrah forest near Manjimup, where foxes are also controlled, up to 70% of diurnal refuges were sites other than tree hollows, including the skirts of grass trees (<em>Xanthorrhoea</em> sp.), stump hollows and hollow logs (Burbidge and de Tores 1998, Wayne <em>et al</em>. 2000).<br/><br/>The diet of the Western Ringtail Possum is variable. When available, Peppermint leaves form the majority of the diet. In their absence, the dominant myrtaceous species are preferred (Jones <em>et al</em>. 1994b). In urban areas (e.g., Bunbury and Busselton), they are known to feed on a variety of garden species, including rose bush leaves and flowers and a variety of fruits. The digestive system reflects adaptation to myrtaceous and other foliage of low nutritional value. Western Ringtail Possums are caecum fermenters having a large caecum where fine digestive material is retained. Larger, coarse, less nutritious material is passed more rapidly. Ringtail Possums are also caecotrophic (i.e., during the day they ingest softer, finer faecal material to assist in returning bacteria to the caecum to aid digestion: Hume and Sakaguchi (1993), Hume <em>et al</em>. (1994)). Successful recruitment depends on seasonal availability of high-quality foliage. When food quality is poor, the sex ratio of young is biased towards males, and recruitment may fail (B. Jones pers. comm). Wayne (2005) reported that 84% of monitored deaths (mostly linked to predation) occurred between April and September, when both male and female body condition was significantly lower than October-March.<br/><br/>Wayne <em>et al</em>. (2006) investigated associations between the relative abundance of the Western Ringtail Possum and anthropogenic disturbances at local and landscape scales within the publicly-managed Jarrah forests of south-western Australia. Logging, fire, fox control and forest fragmentation were investigated in relation to the relative abundance of ringtails at 90 sites within an area of 285,000 ha of the Upper Warren east of Manjimup; the location of the last remaining substantial population of the Western Ringtail Possum in jarrah forest. Overall, abundance was greatest in areas with limited anthropogenic disturbance. At the local scale, abundance was negatively associated with greater fire intensity. At the landscape scale, it was positively associated with fox control and negatively associated with forest fragmentation and distance from non-remnant vegetation (i.e., agriculture and tree plantations). Abundance was also greatest in predominantly unlogged landscapes and in forests that had been regrowing for an average of 40 years since the landscape was most recently logged; in other words, where logging was historically least intense.<br/><br/>Western Ringtail Possums are often killed in moderate or high intensity fires (Inions 1985) and by logging (Morris <em>et al</em>. 2000). Both impacts also expose survivors to elevated predation. Where most resident possums use predominantly low shelter sites, or dreys in the mid-storey, even low intensity fires can severely reduce numbers. Most resident subpopulations appear to require some substantial or dominant proportion of their local habitat to have remained largely unburned and unlogged for periods of at least 2-4 decades (Wayne 2008, Jones <em>et al</em>. 2007). By 2012, it was clear that drey-using fragmented subpopulations (in habitat with only rare, small fire events) were more resilient and persistent than subpopulations in habitat subject to broad-scale fire effects (wildfires or low-intensity prescribed fires).<br/><br/>Young have been recorded as being born throughout the year, with peaks in April to July and September to November (Jones <em>et al</em>. 1994b, Wayne <em>et al</em>. 2005a), but the breeding season can vary. Sexual maturity is reached at about one year. Litter size is usually one, with litters of two being rare, unlike the Common Ringtail Possum (<em>P. peregrinus</em>). Sex ratios can vary, depending on food quality: females predominate when food quality is high, males when it is low. Longevity is unknown. Life spans of <em>P. peregrinus</em> to eight years have been recorded (Jones <em>et al</em>. 1990) and longevity in captivity for that species is up to 10 years (AnAge 2012). Available information suggests that most Western Ringtail Possums do not survive in the wild beyond 3-6 years. Generation length for the Western Ringtail Possum is here assumed to be <em>ca</em> 3 years.","<p>Current threats are:</p>  <ol><li>The drying climate, affecting the nutritional quality of food and hence survival and recruitment. Rainfall has declined and continues to decline throughout the south west of Australia. T2014 and 2015 have been the, or close to the, driest on record near Albany. Albany mean rainfall (1877 to 2014): 929 mm; 2014: 638 (no data from December, mean is 30 mm, if 30 mm added = 668 mm); 2015: 621 mm (lowest on record). Busselton mean (1877 to 2014): 813.6 mm; 2014: 591 mm; 2015: 568 mm. Western Ringtail Possums ‘are among the species most likely to be impacted by predicted climate change in the south-west because they have very specific habitat and dietary requirements, have a poor ability to migrate and have lost large areas of habitat. In addition they are sensitive to drought-induced stress. Over the past 30 years there has been an approximate 20 per cent decline in rainfall in the south-west of WA, with more reductions in rainfall and increased temperatures predicted due to global climate change (Timbal 2004). These changes could result in further contraction of the species to the most fertile and mesic remnants of their extant range (Wayne 2005, Jones and Francesconi 2007)’ (Recovery Plan p. 10). Almost all remaining occurrences are associated with older-growth Peppermint, but few stands now seem to provide suitable nutrition for the species to survive and recruit </li><li>Increasing temperature. ‘Western Ringtail Possums are known to be susceptible to heat stress and can easily overheat at temperatures of 35°C (Yin 2006). Western Ringtail Possums have been observed to use evaporative cooling in hot weather by applying saliva to the forelimbs or panting (Jones <em>et al.</em> 1994b). Jones <em>et al</em>. (1994b) observed that in areas where dreys were used, Western Ringtail Possums went to the ground over several hot days. Western Ringtail Possums are the smallest of the specialist marsupial folivores indicating that they live close to the ecological and physiological limits of viability (B. Jones pers. comm. 2002)’ (Recovery Plan pp. 6-7). As well, increasing temperatures exacerbate soil moisture reduction and further affect the nutritional quality of food.</li><li>Land clearing. Land clearing for urban development remains a threat in the Busselton – Augusta near coastal strip and near Albany. Land clearing continues despite application of the EPBC Act guidelines that aim to assist in determining whether a proposed action is likely to have a significant impact on the Western Ringtail Possum on the southern Swan Coastal Plain. Most remaining habitat is on private land; thus the major land management is via planning controls, not via biodiversity legislation.</li><li>Feral predators. Translocation experiments in the past and other data demonstrate that Red Foxes and feral Cats are major threats, especially where the canopy becomes more open due to ‘parkland clearing’ and after fire. Native predators also impact the species.</li><li>Fire. Fire reduces food availability and opens up the canopy causing ringtails to spend more time on the ground where they can be predated by foxes and cats.</li><li>Tree decline and insect outbreaks. Coastal Peppermint decline, gum leaf skeletoniser and <em>Phytophthora</em> dieback in Jarrah, Tuart decline and other tree declines have resulted in extensive but mainly localised reductions in food and habitat quality.</li><li>Competition for tree hollows. Increased numbers of Brushtail Possums where fox baiting occurs leads to competition for hollows: brushtails are more aggressive and will evict ringtails. Hollow loss is also caused by logging and feral bees.</li><li>Logging. Western Ringtail Possums are more abundant in unlogged forest or where logging has been least intense; logging leads to local mortality including via increased feral Cat predation. However, current WRP distribution does not now significantly overlap areas to be logged to a significant degree.</li><li>Domestic dogs. ‘In urban environments predation or injury by domestic dogs can be frequent (de Tores <em>et al</em>. 1998). High levels of dog ownership within the City of Busselton create dog densities at four to eight times greater per hectare than the average fox density in the south-west forests (K. Williams pers. comm. 2006)’ (Recovery Plan, p.8). Ravens are a threat in urban areas where their numbers have increased.</li><li>A plausible future threat is myrtle rust, which significantly affects peppermint (<em>Agonis flexuosa</em>), in eastern Australia where it is planted horticulturally, noting that peppermint is now the main habitat and food tree for WRPs.</li></ol>  <p>Note that some threats are synergistic.</p>","How <em>et al</em>. (1987) found that subpopulations between Busselton and Albany were small and rapidly diminishing. In the Upper Warren area, Western Ringtail Possums have declined severely in abundance (&gt;95%, probably &gt;99%) between 1998 and 2009 (Wayne <em>et al</em>. 2011, 2012) from an inferred pre-decline abundance of &gt;10,000 individuals (A. Wayne pers comm). Jones <em>et al</em>. (2007) found high-density remnant subpopulations varying between &lt;2 and 20 adults/ha in the Siesta-Kealy area west of Busselton, and Harewood (2009) found densities of <em>ca</em> 13 animals/ha in Busselton urban bushland reserves in 2008 and 2009; however, these high densities are exceptional—many remnant areas now harbour few animals. Scat scores at Ludlow National Park and nearby sites revealed a 30-55% site decline between 2002 and 2012 (B. Jones pers. comm). The results of surveys carried out by consultants for developers are generally unavailable; however, anecdotal and observational evidence indicates that other remnant subpopulations have recently undergone significant decline (B. Jones pers. comm). The major cause of the decline is thought to be climate change (drying and warming) leading to declining food quality: Western Ringtail Possums require relatively high quality food to recruit successfully due to their specialized digestive system. Other implicated factors include continuing habitat loss and fragmentation due to urban development, and predation by introduced Red Foxes and feral cats.<br/><br/>Recent (2015) estimates by Dr B. Jones for each of the five subpopulations are:<br/><ul><li>Southern Swan:&#160; 2,000</li><li>Cape to Cape:&#160; 500</li><li>Other Forest Rivers:&#160; 300</li><li>Upper Warren:&#160; 100</li><li>Around Albany:&#160; 500<br/></li></ul>This implies a probable 2015 total of about 3,400 adult Western Ringtail Possums.<br/><br/>The most recent estimate of numbers at Karakamia, made in 2010, was 38 animals, and spotlighting since then suggests a stable subpopulation (S. Legge pers. comm).<br/><br/>The Upper Warren subpopulation was estimated to be at least 11,000 mature individuals in 2006. Numbers in other regional areas were also significantly higher in 2006, with a total estimate of the population in 2006 being at least 18,000. Thus, available information strongly implies a population size reduction of &gt;80% over the past 10 years. Because rainfall is projected to decline further in south-western Australia, and habitat destruction is likely to continue, this reduction is expected to continue.",Decreasing,"The extent of occurrence of Western Ringtail Possums has contracted in the past and severely contracted in the recent past. Formerly it was patchily distributed across much of south-western Western Australia from 120 km south-east of Geraldton (where it is known from surface cave deposits) to the southern edge of the Nullarbor Plain (where it is also known from surface cave deposits), with the most inland recent records being from Tutanning Nature Reserve east of Pingelly (Shortridge 1909; Sampson 1971; Christensen <em>et al</em>. 1985; How <em>et al</em>. 1987; Baynes 1987; Jones <em>et al</em>. 1994a,b; Jones and Hillcox 1995; Burbidge and de Tores 1998).<br/><br/>By <em>ca</em> 1980, about 80% of the original range was no longer occupied (Jones 2004). It persisted in the coastal strip between Bunbury and Albany (with the range extending inland in riparian habitat between the Collie and Blackwood Rivers), and in the Upper Warren region (Perup Nature Reserve, Greater Kingston National Park and adjacent State forest: Burbidge and de Tores 1998, Wayne <em>et al</em>. 2006). There are a few post-2000 Western Ringtail Possum records across some inland areas in south-western Australia from Yornup in the north to Northcliffe in the south, near Vasse Highway, near Carey forest block in the west and Lake Muir in the east (B. Jones pers. comm).<br/><br/>Currently, it occurs patchily in coastal areas from near Bunbury to the Leeuwin-Naturaliste National Park (with a small isolated translocated subpopulation further north near Dawesville) and near Albany (B. Jones pers. comm). Most of these fragmented habitat remnants are on private land. The largest recent inland subpopulation in the Upper Warren had declined to near extirpation by the mid- to late-2000s (Wayne <em>et al</em>. 2012), so there are now only two subpopulations.<br/><br/>It has been reintroduced to Lane-Poole Conservation Park near Dwellingup, Yalgorup National Park south of Mandurah and Leschenault Conservation Park near Bunbury. However, apart from some Yalgorup translocated animals establishing away from the release site near Dawesville, these reintroductions have failed due to poor-quality food resulting from a drying climate (B. Jones pers. comm.) and to feral cat predation (K. Morris pers. comm). There is a small subpopulation of &lt;50 mature individuals (and therefore not included in this evaluation) in the Karakamia mainland island (Australian Wildlife Conservancy), near Perth.<br/><br/>There are five subpopulations: 'Southern Swan Coastal Plain', 'Cape to Cape' (Cape Naturaliste to Cape Leeuwin), 'Other Forest Rivers', 'Upper Warren' and 'Around Albany'.",,Terrestrial,"Recovery goals, objectives, criteria for success and failure, and recovery actions are described in the Recovery Plan (Department of Parks and Wildlife 2014); however, this was drafted when the species was listed as Vulnerable.<br/><br/>The Recovery Plan includes &gt;30 actions. The most urgent ones are:<br/><br/><em><strong>Monitoring</strong></em>. It is clear that there is insufficient monitoring, especially noting the short-term crash that happened at the Upper Warren where the subpopulation went from &gt;10 000 (probably many tens of thousands) to near zero in about 10 years, and average species’ longevity of c. 3 years. Of particular concern is declining rainfall and increasing temperatures and resulting effects on survival and recruitment, not only in the Bunbury to Augusta area, but also near Albany where there has been a series of dry years and severe, lightning-caused fires in the conservation estate.<br/><br/><strong><em>Research into effects of drying climate, nutritional status of food and how it relates to survival and recruitment</em></strong>. This should include research into the effects of rainfall and artificial watering on the nutritional quality of food and hence recruitment.<br/><br/><strong><em>Predation</em></strong>. Conduct experiments with Eradicat (registered feral cat bait) in key Western Ringtail Possum habitat and measure prey response.<br/><br/><strong><em>Captive breeding</em></strong>. If the species continues to decline at rates seen in the past, captive breeding may be needed at some future time. A pilot study to develop husbandry techniques is indicated.<br/><p></p>  <em></em>",Australasian,,false,false,Global

The species is particularly susceptible because of slow life history characteristics, specialist requirements for large tree hollows (and hence mature forests), and relatively specialised dietary requirements. Across its broad range, the population size and rate of decline is unknown, but a large-scale monitoring program in the central highlands of Victoria demonstrated a decline of <em>c</em>. 9% per year for the period 1997-2010; and a substantial monitoring program in a conservation reserve in coastal New South Wales reported a complete loss of the monitored subpopulation over the period 2002 to 2010 (Lindenmayer <em>et al</em>. 2011). At woodland sites in central Queensland first sampled in 1973-76 and re-sampled in 2001-02, abundance declined by 89% (Woinarski <em>et al</em>. 2006). There is little other published information on population trends over the period relevant to this assessment (<em>c</em>. 22 years), and these sites are not necessarily representative of trends across the species’ range, but they provide sufficient evidence to suspect that the overall rate of population decline exceeds 30% over a 22 year (=three generation) period.","<p>The Greater Glider is an arboreal marsupial, largely restricted to eucalypt forests and woodlands. It is primarily folivorous, with a diet mostly comprising eucalypt leaves, and occasionally flowers (Kehl and Borsboom 1984; Kavanagh and Lambert 1990; van der Ree <em>et al</em>. 2004). Highest abundance is typically in taller, montane, moist eucalypt forests, with relatively old trees and abundant hollows (Andrews <em>et al</em>. 1994; Smith <em>et al</em>. 1994a,b; Kavanagh 2000; Eyre 2004; van der Ree <em>et al</em>. 2004; Vanderduys <em>et al</em>. 2012). The distribution may be patchy even in suitable habitat (Kavanagh 2000). The Greater Glider favours forests with a diversity of eucalypt species, due to seasonal variation in preference for food tree species (Kavanagh 1984).<br/><br/>During the day it shelters in tree hollows, with a particular selection for large hollows in large, old trees (Henry 1984; Kehl and Borsboom 1984; Lindenmayer <em>et al</em>. 1991; Smith <em>et al</em>. 2007; Goldingay 2012). In Grafton/Casino, Urbenville and Urunga/Coffs Harbour Forestry Management Areas (FMAs) in northern New South Wales, the abundance of Greater Gliders on survey sites was significantly greater on sites with a higher abundance of tree hollows (Andrews <em>et al</em>. 1994; Smith <em>et al</em>. 1994a,b). In the Grafton/Casino FMA, the Greater Glider was absent from surveyed sites with fewer than six tree hollows per hectare (Smith <em>et al</em>. 1994a). In southern Queensland, Greater Gliders need at least 2-4 live den trees for every 2 ha of suitable forest habitat (Eyre 2002).<br/><br/>Home ranges are typically relatively small (1-4 ha: Henry 1984; Kehl and Borsboom 1984; Comport <em>et al</em>. 1996; Gibbons and Lindenmayer 2002; Pope <em>et al</em>. 2005), but are larger in lower productivity forests and more open woodlands (to 16 ha: Eyre 2004; Smith <em>et al</em>. 2007), and larger for males than for females (Kavanagh and Wheeler 2004; Pope <em>et al</em>. 2005), with male home ranges being largely non-overlapping (Henry 1984; Kavanagh and Wheeler 2004; Pope <em>et al</em>. 2005).<br/><br/>The Greater Glider is considered to be particularly sensitive to forest clearance (Tyndale-Biscoe and Smith 1969a), and to intensive logging (Kavanagh and Bamkin 1995; Kavanagh and Webb 1998; Kavanagh and Wheeler 2004; Kavanagh <em>et al</em>. 1995), although responses vary according to landscape context and the extent of tree removal and retention (Kavanagh 2000; Taylor <em>et al</em>. 2007). The Greater Glider is also sensitive to wildfire (Lunney 1987; Andrews <em>et al</em>. 1994; Lindenmayer <em>et al</em>. 2011), and slow to recover following major disturbance (Kavanagh 2004). In Urbenville FMA of northern New South Wales, the abundance of Greater Gliders on survey sites was significantly greater in forests that were infrequently burnt (Andrews <em>et al</em>. 1994).<br/><br/>Notwithstanding relatively small home ranges, but in part because of low dispersal ability, Greater Gilders may be sensitive to fragmentation (Eyre 2006; McCarthy and Lindenmayer 1999ab; Lindenmayer et al. 2000; Taylor and Goldingay 2009), have relatively low persistence in small forest fragments, and disperse poorly across vegetation that is not native forest. Modelling suggests that they need native forest patches of at least 160 km<sup>2</sup> to maintain viable populations (Eyre 2002).<br/><br/>Females give birth to a single young, from March to June (Tyndale-Biscoe and Smith 1969b; McKay 2008). Sexual maturity is reached in the second year (Tyndale-Biscoe and Smith 1969b). Longevity has been estimated at 15 years (Harris and Maloney 2010), so generation length is 7-8 years. The relatively low reproductive rate (Henry 1984) may render small isolated populations in small remnants prone to extinction (van der Ree 2004; Pope <em>et al</em>. 2005).</p>","Land clearing for agriculture, logging, and bushfires adversely affects this species throughout its range, with these threats exacerbated because of need for large trees with hollows and very limited dispersal. Modelling indicates severe range contraction for northern subspecies (Kearney <em>et al</em>. 2010)","<p>There is no reliable estimate of population size. Lunney <em>et al</em>. (2008) considered that it had a ‘presumed large population’ and was ‘locally common’. Winter <em>et al</em>. (2004) considered it ‘common’ in the north Queensland portion of its range. In New South Wales, Kavanagh (2004) considered it ‘widespread and common … particularly in north-eastern New South Wales’. Density estimates in Victoria range from 0.6 to 2.8 individuals/ha (Henry 1984; van der Ree <em>et al</em>. 2004), and across its broader range from 0.01 to 5 individuals/ha (Kavanagh 1984; Kehl and Borsboom 1984; Maloney 2007). In southern Queensland, trees with hollows are extremely limited in some extensive forest types that have been historically used for timber production, and this in turn limits Greater Glider distribution and abundance (Eyre 2006).<br/><br/>Lunney <em>et al</em>. (2008) stated that the population was decreasing. Maloney (2007) described the loss of one isolated population (at Royal National Park) due to fire, and regional-scale decline (in the Illawarra area).<br/><br/>Lindenmayer <em>et al</em>. (2011) reported results from two substantial monitoring programs, in the central highlands of Victoria and at Jervis Bay. Over the period 1997 to 2010, the Greater Glider declined by an average of 8.8% per year in the central highlands sites (i.e. a rate that if extrapolated over the 22 year period relevant to this assessment is 87%), with higher rates of decline in forests subject to logging than in conservation reserves, and with losses (to 2010) of Greater Gliders at all sites burnt by a major wildfire in 2009. At the Jervis Bay (Booderee National Park) site, the Greater Glider was recorded from 22 of 110 sampled sites in 2002, but has not been recorded at all in repeated surveys at those sites since 2007.<br/><br/>In central Queensland, the abundance of Greater Gliders declined by 89% across a series of 31 woodland sites sampled initially in 1973-76 and then re-sampled in 2001-02 (Woinarski <em>et al</em>. 2006).</p>",Decreasing,"The Greater Glider is endemic to eastern Australia, where it ranges from Windsor Tableland in far northern Queensland to the Wombat Forest in central Victoria.

Trenching surveys have shown that potential habitat appears to be simply described as aeolian dunes. They spend almost their entire life underground, only very occasionally coming to the surface, and only remaining on the surface for a short time. Most specimens and sightings come from animals found on the surface. However, it appears they rarely come to the surface, which makes them less prone to predation by Red Foxes, Cats and other predators.<br/><br/>When underground, marsupial moles virtually swim through the soil. The sand is packed in behind the animal as it progresses and no empty tunnel is formed. Nevertheless, where one has passed through a soil profile, an oval shaped differentiation in soil texture and colour can be seen (Johnson and Walton 1989). Evidence of 80 kilometres of backfilled tunnel per hectare is average in areas where Kakarratul occur (Benshemesh and Mann 2009; Benshemesh and Schulz 2009), representing up to 1% of the soil within one metre of the surface.<br/><br/>Kakarratul, like Itjaritjari, are insectivorous, capturing their prey while underground (Pavey <em>et al</em>. 2012). There have been no analyses of gut contents, but the diet is probably similar to Itjaritjari comprising mainly insects, particularly ants and some beetle larvae.<br/><br/>Marsupial moles may be common prey items of larger mammalian predators, especially the introduced Red Fox. In the known range of Kakarratul, Benshemesh <em>et al</em>. (2010) found remains of marsupial moles in 8% of predator scats, especially foxes, although differences in incidence in scats between foxes and dingos (and cats) were not significant. Sign of marsupial mole was found in approximately 5% of predator scats collected from 2008 to 2012 in the Martu native title determination I Western Australia (A. McGilvray <em>pers. comm</em>. 2014). It is uncertain whether these predators take marsupial moles on the surface or dig them up, or indeed whether they are actually killing moles or taking dead animals. Dead or severely debilitated moles have been recorded on the surface on several occasions (Benshemesh 2004) but it seems most likely that these predators prey upon living moles that are on or just under the surface. R. T. Maurice, who travelled widely in the Great Victoria Desert between 1897 and 1903, reported that local Aboriginal people were able to capture Itjaritjari after hearing them when they were under the surface (Gara 1996 cited in Benshemesh 2004), and larger mammalian predators may do likewise. Benshemesh <em>et al</em>. (2010) found some evidence that Dingoes, at least, hunted Kakarratul in northern areas where it was common to find the remains of more than one marsupial mole in each dingo scat. On the surface, marsupial moles are vulnerable to a wide range of predators including birds of prey, snakes and goannas.<br/><br/>A study of the metabolic physiology of a single Kakarratul concluded that it differs in some aspects of thermal and metabolic physiology from other marsupials, most likely reflecting its almost completely fossorial existence (Withers <em>et al</em>. 2000).<br/><br/>Almost nothing is known of reproduction or longevity in marsupial moles (Benshemesh and Johnson 2003).

Predation by introduced predators - Dingos, Red Foxes and feral cats - has been invoked as a significant threat; however, recent data suggests the species is widespread and relatively common.

Where Itjaritjari are known to occur, their underground backfilled tunnels are often very common and these may represent an important source of soil disturbance (biopedturbation) (Whitford and Kay 1999). Evidence of 30-60 kilometres of backfilled tunnel per hectare is usual in these areas (Benshemesh 2004), representing about 40-80 m<sup>3</sup> of turned-over soil per hectare, or up to 1% of the soil within one metre of the surface.<br/><br/>Itjaritjari are insectivorous, capturing their prey while underground. Examination of gut contents of preserved specimens and of the habitat they occupy, has revealed a generalist diet comprising two main prey types: social insects (ants and termites) and the larvae of beetles. Ants, termites and beetle larvae were also the main invertebrates captured in soil cores on sandridges; other invertebrates combined contributed &lt;5% to abundance (Pavey <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/><br/>Recent studies suggest that marsupial moles may be common prey items of larger mammalian predators. Paltridge (1998) found remains of marsupial moles in predator scats at five of her six study sites in the Tanami Desert. Her study revealed that 10% of Red Fox scats, 3% of Cat scats and 5% of Dingo scats contained signs of moles (n= 82, 111 and 59 respectively). Signs of marsupial moles have also been found in Red Fox and Dingo scats from the Anangu-Pitjantjatjara / Yankunytjatjara Lands in South Australia (Benshemesh 2004), and in other areas of the Northern Territory (Paltridge 1998), although not as frequently. Benshemesh <em>et al</em>. (2010) examined nearly 1800 predator scats from both southern and northern dunefields and found little difference between the likelihood of finding marsupial mole signs in scats of Red Foxes, cats and Dingoes, but major differences between northern and southern areas. In southern areas inhabited by Itjaritjari, only 1% of predator scats contained traces of marsupial moles, compared with 8% in northern areas largely inhabited by Kakarratul, a difference they attributed to the higher abundance of marsupial moles in the north and shallower burrowing habits. It is uncertain whether these predators take marsupial moles on the surface or dig them up, or indeed whether they are actually killing moles or taking dead animals. Dead or severely debilitated moles have been recorded on the surface on several occasions (Benshemesh 2004), but it seems most likely that these predators prey upon living moles that are on or just under the surface.

The subpopulations there undergo substantial fluctuations in abundance, depending on seasonal conditions, with that fluctuation approaching one order of magnitude. The species was reintroduced to Faure Island in 2005 and this subpopulation is now growing. It was translocated (assisted colonization) to the Arid Recovery Project mainland island (Roxby Downs, South Australia) in 2000 and this subpopulation is also self-sustaining. This species is listed as Vulnerable under criterion D2 as there are fewer than five locations and there are plausible threats to all subpopulations because of the drying climate in Shark Bay, short generation length and large local fluctuations in subpopulation size. </p>","<p>The Western Barred Bandicoot is the smallest bandicoot and the only one where females are larger than males, although this may be the case only on Bernier and Dorre Islands and be the result of island dwarfism (Short <em>et al</em>. 1998). Habitats recorded for mainland animals included a variety of fairly open vegetation types in semi-arid and arid parts of southern Australia, such as ‘at the base of elevated dunes’ on Peron Peninsula, Shark Bay (Quoy and Gaimard 1824), dense scrub including thickets of <em>Allocasuarina</em> seedlings, open bluebush and saltbush plains and stony hills bordering scrub (Friend 2008). Their preference for open vegetation, contrasting with <em>Isoodon</em> spp., which typically occur in more dense vegetation, would have made them particularly susceptible to predation by feral Cats and Red Foxes (Short <em>et al</em>. 1998).<br/><br/>On Bernier and Dorre Islands Western Barred Bandicoots are particularly common in scrub associated with vegetated dunes behind beaches, but occur in all vegetation types (Friend 2008; Short <em>et al</em>. 1998). They shelter during daytime in well-concealed nests made from plant material and constructed in a hemispherical hollow scrape beneath a low or prostrate shrub. Near the coast, nests may be made from accumulated dead seagrass (Friend 2008).<br/><br/>As with other bandicoot species the adult sex ratio of trapped animals is male biased even though pouch young are close to 1:1. This may be due to adult males having a larger home range and being more mobile than females. One to three pouch young are carried between March and November, suggesting that breeding does not occur in summer. Females can reach sexual maturity in 3-5 months of age at a body weight of 175 g, or 74% of average adult weight. Sexual maturity in males occurs a little later, at 4-6 months or 195 g, being 93% of average adult weight. The subpopulation size after a drought on Dorre Island broke doubled in 1.07 years (Short <em>et al</em>. 1998). Winter breeding in this species makes it dependent on adequate late summer and/or winter rainfall. However the data from Faure Island suggest higher reproductive rate in spring, possibly due to greater resource availability and recent rainfall in the winter months (S. Legge <em>pers. comm</em>. 2014).<br/><br/>Mean longevity at Heirisson Prong was eight months for males and ten months for females, although one animal lived to at least 4.25 years; however, this subpopulation was subjected to low levels of predation by feral Cats (Richards and Short 2003). On Faure Island, median lifespan is about 3 years (S. Legge <em>pers. comm</em>. 2014). In captivity longevity has been as high as 8 years (Richards 2011). Adult longevity in the wild is unknown, but is assumed to be about two to three years, similar to that reported for the Eastern Barred Bandicoot <em>P. gunnii</em> (Seebeck and Menkhorst 2008). As sexual maturity is reached by five months, the generation time is here assumed to be 1 to 1.5 years.<br/><br/>Papillomas and carcinomas have been detected in Western Barred Bandicoots from Bernier Island and these have been shown to be caused by a previously-unknown virus (Woolford <em>et al</em>. 2007) that can cause death. A workshop held in 2002 (Friend 2002) resulted in management and research recommendations aimed at minimising the spread of the virus from Bernier Island and ensuring that translocated animals were free of the disease. The presence of this disease has meant that only Dorre Island bandicoots are available for translocations.</p>","The current major threats to the natural subpopulations of the species include: the accidental introduction of predators (introduced cats and foxes), fire, and disease (Richards 2007). These same threats apply to varying degrees to the reintroduced populations. Fluctuations in subpopulations on islands are a threat, but this threat is seen as minor relative to the risk of exotic predators being introduced (Short <em>et al.</em> 1997). However, with extreme weather events becoming more common and all but one location for the species being located in Shark Bay, these fluctuations are a cause for concern. Introduced rats and mice are also a concern, but to a lesser degree than introduced predators.<br/><br/>On the mainland this species was probably extirpated through predation by introduced cats, dogs, and foxes, modification of vegetation by rabbits and stock, and possibly changed fire regimes in parts of the range (Maxwell <em>et al.</em> 1996). Pathogens are a problem in Bernier Island (they seem to be endemic in the subpopulation); the impact of these diseases on the subpopulation size is unknown.","<p>The former abundance of the Western Barred Bandicoot on the mainland is unknown, but early accounts suggest that it was abundant in some areas. For Bernier and Dorre Islands, Short <em>et al</em>. (1997) estimated that the combined minimum population estimate was 2200 to 4000, depending on conditions of drought or average rainfall respectively. These subpopulations undergo very substantial fluctuations in abundance depending on seasonal conditions (Short <em>et al.</em> 1997).&#160; Numbers were reported by Short <em>et al.</em> (1997) to decline 75% in a drought extending from October 1986 to April 1989. In more recent years, the Department of Environment and Conservation has been using spotlight traverses and ‘Distance’ software to estimate the population on Bernier and Dorre Islands annually (from 2006 to 2013). Results show that in response to rainfall conditions, the subpopulation on Bernier Island has fluctuated between an estimated 120 and 900 animals, and the subpopulation on Dorre Island between 140 and 1500 animals (L. Reinhold <em>pers. comm</em>. 2014). The Faure Island subpopulation was estimated to be 100 in 2009 and over 500 in 2011 (S. Legge <em>pers. comm</em>. 2014). It can be anticipated that this subpopulation will also fluctuate substantially in response to rainfall once it reaches carrying capacity. The estimate of subpopulation size at the Arid Recovery mainland island in 2011 was 350 (<a href=""http://www.aridrecovery.org.au/annual-report"">http://www.aridrecovery.org.au/annual-report</a>). Monitoring is undertaken via track counts; data show that numbers increased following the initial translocation and have remained steady over the past 3-5 years (C. Lynch <em>pers. comm</em>. 2014). It seems likely that the two translocated subpopulations will fluctuate substantially once they reach carrying capacity because of the short generation length and varying rainfall.</p>",Stable,"<p>The Western Barred Bandicoot formerly occurred from near Onslow, Western Australia, through the south-west of Western Australia (Friend 1990), the Nullarbor Plain and southern South Australia (Kemper 1990) to western New South Wales and north-western Victoria (Menkhorst and Seebeck 1990).

Across both subspecies, the total population is declining at a rate that is about 30% over 10 years, and this rate may increase in the near future due to increasing predation pressure.</p>","In Tasmania, populations inhabit open grasslands and areas of pastoral development with patches of dense groundcover (Seebeck 2001, Seebeck and Menkhorst 2008). On the mainland, the species formerly occupied the native grasslands and grassy woodlands of the western volcanic plains of Victoria. Reintroduced populations have been established in grasslands and grassy woodlands, often dominated by exotic plant species (Maxwell <em>et al.</em> 1996). Females give birth to between one and five young (but usually two or three) (Seebeck and Menkhorst 2008).&#160;Reproduction can occur throughout the year, but may be depressed during extended low rainfall periods (Hill <em>et al</em>. 2010). Under favourable conditions, the Eastern Barred Bandicoot is highly fecund, with females able to produce up to 4-5 litters per year (Seebeck 1979).","Eastern Barred Bandicoots probably disappeared from the mainland due to introduced predators and habitat destruction from introduced herbivores. Predation from red foxes is thought to have been particularly detrimental, and the recent introduction of foxes to Tasmania could pose a major threat to the species here. Introduced sheep and rabbits also cleared large areas of bandicoot habitat on the mainland, which must have led to reduced populations. In Tasmania populations are fragmented in parts of its range, but this is probably not a major threat (Seebeck and Menkhorst 2008). Disease&#160;(toxoplasmosis) likely to be having some detrimental impacts&#160;(Obendorf and Munday 1990; Obendorf <em>et al</em>. 1996; Bryant and Jackson 1999; Bettiol <em>et al</em>. 1998, 2000).","<p>The original wild population of Eastern Barred Bandicoot (Victoria) is presumed extinct, and this taxon now exists in two reintroduced population (with a combined population of 350 ± 100 individuals) and a captive population of 15 breeding pairs (total 50 individuals) (information current at November 2012: R.

The last record from South Australia was in the late 1800s (Kemper 1990), and the last wild Victorian subpopulation was extirpated in about 2002 (Hill <em>et al</em>. 2010). On the mainland, its present range is restricted to two reintroduced subpopulations within predator-proof fencing (mainland islands): Hamilton Community Parklands (1 km²<sup></sup>), and Mt Rothwell (4 km²<sup></sup>). Its Tasmanian distribution is still relatively extensive, but it has disappeared from substantial parts of its former range (Driessen <em>et al</em>. 1996; Mallick <em>et al</em>. 1997ab).&#160;The species ranges in elevation from sea level to 950 m in Tasmania, but it is usually found much lower there and on the mainland (Seebeck 2001).",,Terrestrial,"Eastern Barred Bandicoot occurs in protected areas. The most important conservation measure for the species as a whole is the control of fox populations in Tasmania. <br/><br/>Recovery efforts on the mainland are complex, multi-disciplinary, and involve many organisations and individuals; several research projects are under way, including collaborative projects with universities, covering biology and ecology of reintroduced populations, establishment at new sites, and population dynamics of foxes at bandicoot release sites; there is considerable community interest and involvement in the recovery program, especially with releases onto private land. A Recovery Plan for the mainland subspecies has been developed (Watson and Halley 2000;&#160;Hill <em>et al</em>. 2010). <br/><br/>Management actions underway for the mainland population include: captive breeding, ongoing since 1988.

There are four reintroduction sites in Victoria, but only one, Woodlands Historic Park near Melbourne, has a reasonably secure population (&gt;700 animals). The others are small, highly vulnerable, and will rely on supplementary releases for the next few years. Not all of these sites contain sufficient habitat for populations to be self-sustaining in the short- to medium-term; habitat management through fencing, tree planting, native grassland management, weed and rabbit control variously occur at all sites; intensive predator control is maintained at all release sites, with regular poisoning, shooting and destruction of dens and other refuges.",Australasian,,false,false,Global

Burrows are usually isolated, but may be complex and there may be many within a relatively small area; an individual Bilby may dig more than 12 burrows within its home range. Bilbies are nocturnal and burrows are occupied during daylight and intermittently during the night.

Most food is obtained by digging. Mature males range more widely than females and have been recorded occupying burrows over 5 km apart on consecutive days (Southgate and Possingham 1995; McRae 2004). Estimates of short-term home range sizes in the Northern Territory varied from 1.1 to 3 km<sup>2</sup> (Southgate and Paltridge 1998).

Bilby sign has been detected in the Martu and Birriliburu determinations, and on-ground activities to protect these populations are being implemented by the traditional owners.</p><p>  </p><p>In Queensland, Bilby subpopulations are managed via control of introduced predators. Some indigenous ranger groups in the Northern Territory and Western Australia are carrying out fire and predator management. In the desert rangelands area of Western Australia, traditional owners are implementing on-ground activities in areas where Bilbies have been detected through the track-based monitoring program, the key activity being implemented being cool-season patch burning to create a diversity of food resources and habitat, and shelter from predators. Traditional hunting of predators is also encouraged in the desert rangelands, particularly close to Aboriginal communities on country, though the feasibility of maintaining low densities of predators in more remote areas through traditional hunting is very limited. In the Tanami Desert, Northern Territory, the Central Land Council is developing a discriminatory baiting program at one of the most important Bilby sites. Studies of predator diets in this area have revealed a high proportion of Cat remains in Dingo scats. In an attempt to control the fox population without affecting the resident Dingoes, fox-specific bait stations are being trialled in habitats frequented by Dingoes. Expert tracking skills also assist strategically placement of fox baits on the ground along regularly used fox trails and broad-scale baiting is being conducted in surrounding habitats where Dingoes and Bilbies only occasionally occur, to create a buffer zone of low fox density (R. Paltridge pers. comm.). In the Kiwirrkurra-Lake Mackay region of Western Australia, Bilbies are persisting at sites where Pintubi continue to conduct regular Cat hunting and frequent patch burning (R. Paltridge pers. comm.).</p>  <p></p>",Australasian,,false,false,Global

Its habitat includes a range of eucalypt forest types, from tall and wet forest dominated by <em>Eucalyptus grandis</em> and tall forest dominated by <em>E. resinifera</em>, abutting the rainforest, to medium height and drier woodlands dominated by <em>Corymbia citriodora</em> and <em>C. platyphylla</em> (Johnson and McIlwee 1997, Dennis 2001, Winter <em>et al</em>. 2008).</p>    <p>This species is solitary and nocturnal. Northern Bettongs are heavily dependent on truffles (the underground fruiting bodies of fungi) as a food source during the wetter parts of the year. The more than 35 species eaten comprise over 45% of their diet, depending on location and season. They also eat roots, tubers, the underground parts of grasses, small invertebrates, and seeds; Cockatoo Grass <em>Alloteropsis semialata</em> is particularly important food when truffle abundance is low (Winter <em>et al</em>. 2008, Bateman and Johnson 2011). During the late part of the dry season when truffle availability is low they are particularly dependent on the swollen underground tubers of Cockatoo Grass (A. Baker pers. comm).</p>    <p>Home ranges are typically 50-70 hectares, but may be as large as 120 hectares (Winter <em>et al</em>. 2008). Vernes (2003) found that male Northern Bettongs have a larger range of movements than females, 72 ± 10.9 ha versus 49 ± 8.4 ha. However, both genders had a high mean rate of movement while foraging. Ranges overlapped for individuals, both between and within sexes. At the site studied by Vernes (2000), small-scale, low intensity fire had no impact on the location or use of individuals’ home ranges. Both during and after a fire, individuals remained within the limits of their movements prior to the fire and there was no direct or indirect mortality of bettongs associated with fire. Despite the lack of broad-scale changes to movements associated with fire, there were clear changes in the fine scale movements and foraging patterns of bettongs immediately after a fire. Search effort for truffles becomes focussed, the level of foraging success is higher and the foraging path more sinuous in recently burnt areas compared to unburnt areas (Vernes 2000). At the site studied by Vernes (2000), fire did not completely remove cover, with bettongs particularly seeking shelter under boulders which are common at the site; the impacts of fire may be different elsewhere, particularly sites on rhyolite (much of the Coane Range population) where boulders are rare. </p>","The main threats tot his species are:<br/><ol><li>Predation by feral cats (moderate to severe): feral Cats shown to be a significant predator of the closely-related Woylie in south-western Australia.</li><li>Climate change (moderate to severe): detailed climate modelling has shown that extended drought is likely to reduce the distribution of Northern Bettong by altering the productivity of its major food resources, and is plausibly a cause of the apparent decline of the Coane Range population (Bateman 2010; Bateman <em>et al</em>. 2012 a, b).&#160;</li><li>Small, relictual subpopulations (moderate): only Lamb Range subpopulations appear large enough to be self sustaining (Dennis 2001, 2012); it is not known whether small populations on Mt Windsor and Coane Range still persist.</li><li>Habitat change due to changed fire regimes (moderate): past declines are thought to relate to changes in habitat structure and suitability for both the bettong and the fungi and grasses it consumes; changes were probably influenced by changed fire regimes (Bateman and Johnson 2011, Dennis 2012); small-scale, low-intensity fire has little effect, at least in habitats where physical cover (e.g. boulders) is available (Vernes 2000, Vernes and Pope 2001), but may be significant in other habitats, and especially in combination with Foxes and feral Cats.</li><li>Competition from Pigs (<em>Sus scrofa</em>) (moderate): impact unclear: evidence of their impact is still scant but they known to consume (and cause reduction in abundance of) truffles and Cockatoo Grass tubers (A. Baker pers. comm).</li><li>Habitat change due to livestock grazing (moderate): past declines are thought to relate to changes in habitat structure and suitability for both the bettong and the fungi it consumes; changes were probably influenced by grazing (Bateman and Johnson 2011; Dennis 2001, 2012).</li><li>Habitat change due to logging (moderate): past declines are thought to relate to changes in habitat structure and suitability for both the bettong and the fungi it consumes; changes were probably influenced by logging (Bateman and Johnson 2011, Dennis 2012).</li><li>Inappropriate land use (moderate):very little of the range of the Northern Bettong is in National Park, although much of it occurs in State Forest and/or in the Wet Tropics World Heritage Area, managed by the   Department of Environment and Resource Management; State Forest is often managed as a multi-use area which can include timber extraction, water catchment protection, tourism and recreational camping; standard management practices and/or problems associated with these uses may be detrimental to northern bettongs (Dennis 2001); the Coane Range population is largely within the Australian Wildlife Conservancy’s Mount Zero – Taravale wildlife sanctuary, and is managed with the conservation of Northern Bettong as a specific objective.</li><li>Predation by Red Foxes (potentially catastrophic, but currently not occurring): foxes are not established in the current range of <em>B. tropica</em>, but have occasionally been observed in area; foxes are considered to be the greatest future threat to the species (Dennis 2001, 2012) given their impact on related species.</li></ol>","Of the three localities with confirmed extant populations, only the Lamb Range (includes Davies Creek, Emu Creek and Tinaroo subpopulations) has a substantial number of individuals over a broad area (densities of 4-7 individuals/km²). Mt. Carbine Tableland (and formerly the Coane Range) have small and restricted subpopulations occurring at low densities (Dennis 2001, Winter <em>et al</em>. 2008). No Northern Bettongs have been seen at either the Coane Range or Mt Windsor Tableland since 2003, despite considerable survey effort, and the status of this population is unknown (Dennis 2001, Winter <em>et al</em>. 2008, Bateman <em>et al</em>. 2012b, Mulder <em>et al</em>. 2012).",Decreasing,"The Northern Bettong is endemic to north-eastern Queensland.

One other locality, Mt Windsor Tableland, may have an extant population (last confirmed record 2003: Dennis 2012). A population in the vicinity of Ravenshoe has not been seen since the 1920s. A single individual was recorded from the Dawson Valley (near Rockhampton) in 1884; no Northern Bettongs have been seen in this area since that year (Dennis 2001; Winter <em>et al</em>. 2008). It has been recorded at elevations between 800 m and 1,200 m asl (Winter <em>et al</em>. 2008).

It is listed on Appendix I of CITES.<br/>  <p>Past conservation actions have been described by Dennis (2001) and included surveys, research into fire ecology including investigating the impact of varying fire regimes on Northern Bettong food resources (truffles and cockatoo grass) and a GPS tracking study investigating micro habitat use following prescribed burning, research into population genetics and mating systems, surveys of fox distribution and abundance and the partial development of a fox control plan.</p>    <p>Current management, monitoring and research includes cattle exclusion research investigating the recovery of/impact on resources (cockatoo grass) following exclusion of feral cattle, application of fire management a research program. Findings indicated application of landscape mosaic burn pattern in the early to mid dry season was most conducive to creating the species-diverse open structured ground layer preferred by the Northern Bettong. This regime is also most suitable for the survival and proliferation of cockatoo grass, a food resource essential to Bettongs in the late dry season when truffle availability is low </p>    Conservation of the Northern Bettong is the responsibility of the Queensland Department of National Parks, Recreation, Sport and Racing. Most of its habitat has now been incorporated into the protected area estate, both government and private (Australian Wildlife Conservancy), and is being managed for the bettong’s conservation by de-stocking, ceasing logging, managing fire and weeds and monitoring the vegetation and the bettong.

It is assessed as Vulnerable because it has a small area of occupancy (AOO): the calculated AOO is 196 km² (which meets the criterion B threshold for Endangered), however the paucity of recent points in our mapping database plus knowledge of the species suggests a larger AOO (but &lt;2,000 km²). Its distribution is severely fragmented, and there is a continuing decline in area of occupancy, suitable habitat, number of locations, and number of mature individuals.","The Golden Bandicoot is nocturnal. On Barrow Island, Golden Bandicoots shelter in medium-sized or large spinifex <em>Triodia</em> spp. hummocks and in limestone caves and crevices. Food is obtained by digging and foraging and includes insects, small reptiles and mammals, sea turtle eggs, roots and tubers. Females give birth to two young, both of which may survive, throughout the year, but the proportion of females with young increases after heavy rainfall. In the Kimberley, diet includes insects and plant material. On Marchinbar Island it occurs mainly in heath and shrublands on sandstone and individuals maintain overlapping home ranges of 12-35 ha and their diet includes a broad range of invertebrates (Southgate <em>et al</em>. 1996). Feral dogs took bandicoots on Marchinbar but were eradicated in 2004-2005. Black Rats <em>Rattus rattus</em> occurred on Barrow and Middle Islands but were eradicated in 1991 (Morris 2002). A research program on Golden Bandicoots at Artesian Range, Kimberley (Australian Wildlife Conservancy/University of Tasmania) that began in late 2012 aims to describe the impacts of fire patterns and feral Cats on their ecology and survival. In this study, Golden Bandicoots have been caught in heavily dissected sandstone and in thick riparian grassland where they make a network of runways and shelter sites beneath grass tufts. Radio-tracked individuals moved regularly between shelter sites over a 600&#160;m long riparian strip grading to grassy foothills. At some sites the Golden Bandicoot was sympatric with the Northern Brown Bandicoot <em>I. macrourus</em>.","On mainland Kimberley, Golden Bandicoots are threatened by feral cats combined with changing fire regimes. These two threats work synergistically to the detriment of the species, whereby ground cover reduced by fire makes bandicoots more susceptible to predation (Palmer <em>et al.</em> 2003). Feral dogs on Marchinbar may have been a minor threat, but these were eradicated in 2004-2005 (Palmer and Woinarski 2006). There is a minor risk of introduced predators establishing on Barrow and Middle Islands. Lower densities on Middle Island (relative to Barrow Island) may have been due to competition from the introduced Black Rat (<em>Rattus rattus</em>), however, these were eradicated in 1993 and since then numbers appear to have increase (Morris 2002, McKenzie <em>et al.</em> 2008).<br/><br/>The reasons for past declines of the Golden Bandicoot are predation by feral cats and red foxes, and inappropriate fire regimes (the Aboriginal fire regime of mostly small fires and a heterogeneous landscape has been replaced by very large, hot wild fires).","There is no robust estimate of population size. It is abundant on Barrow Island (densities of up to 10 adults ha<sup>-1 </sup>in sandy areas, and population size &gt;20,000 individuals: McKenzie <em>et al.</em> 2008) and relatively abundant on some other islands, but is rare and probably declining in mainland Kimberley. The population on Marchinbar Island was estimated at 1400 individuals in 1994-95 (Woinarski <em>et al</em>. 2007), based on limited density information derived from radio-tracking and intensive trapping&#160; (Southgate <em>et al</em>. 1996).
